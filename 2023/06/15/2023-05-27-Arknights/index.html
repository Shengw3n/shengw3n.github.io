                <p>This post aims to employ mathematical modeling to estimate the expected number of pulls required to obtain a single <strong>random</strong> 6-star character in the mobile game Arknights. Feel free to utilize the provided catalog on the right-hand side to navigate to the specific sections that pique your interest.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Arknights"><a href="#What-is-Arknights" class="headerlink" title="What is Arknights"></a>What is Arknights</h2><p>Arknights is a popular mobile tower defense game where players take on the role of a “Doctor” leading a team of unique operators to defend against threats in a dystopian world. </p>
<p>The game incorporates a gacha system that revolves around acquiring new operators through randomized draws, each with designated probabilities. Operators are categorized by their star ratings, with 6-star operators considered the most powerful and 1-star operators the least. The probability of obtaining a 6-star operator stands at 2% per entry by default, although exceptions may apply as detailed below:</p>
<p>In-game description of the pity system:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you do not roll a 6-star operator after 50 rolls, the probability of obtaining a 6-star Operator on the next roll will be increased from <strong>2%</strong> to <strong>4%</strong>. If you still do not roll a 6-star Operator, the probability of obtaining a 6-star Operator on the next row will be further increased from <strong>4%</strong> to <strong>6%</strong>, and this process repeats until a maximum probability of <strong>100%</strong>, at which point you are guaranteed to receive a 6-star Operator.”  </p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="What-is-the-problem"><a href="#What-is-the-problem" class="headerlink" title="What is the problem?"></a>What is the problem?</h2><p>We know the probability of obtaining a six-star unit in Arknights upon each individual roll, but <strong>we do not know the expected number of rolls required to obtain a six-star unit</strong>.</p>
<p>Knowing the expected value of obtaining a six-star is important because players needs to determine the amount of Orundum (Arknights’ Gacha currency) they need to accumulate prior to event banners in order to safely secure their desired operators. This question is increasingly relevant, particularly with the recent launch of the Limited Event “IL Siracusano”. </p>
<p>Numerous attempts have been made to tackle this problem, such as utilizing the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rpubs.com/zyLiu6707/arknights-pull-simulation">Monte Carlo Approach</a> or running <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rpubs.com/Frizu/arknightsgacha">Exploratory Data Analysis</a>. In this post, I will attempt to construct a mathematical model that can be employed to determine this average, offering another perspective on this intriguing problem.</p>

<h2 id="Modeling-the-1st-to-50th-Entry"><a href="#Modeling-the-1st-to-50th-Entry" class="headerlink" title="Modeling the 1st to 50th Entry"></a>Modeling the 1st to 50th Entry</h2><p>To establish our model, it’s important to consider that we are guaranteed to obtain a six-star unit by the 99th entry as our success rate will have increased to 100% by that point. Therefore, our focus lies within the range of the 1st to 99th entries, as our objective is to secure a single 6-star Operator. </p>
<p>For the 1st to 50th entry, there is a fixed success rate of 2% per entry, indicating a clear manifestation of a binomial distribution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To apply the binomial distribution, we must ensure that four conditions are met: 1) a fixed number of entries, 2) independence between each entry, 3) two possible outcomes (success or failure) for each entry, and 4) a constant probability of success throughout. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The binomial distribution equation is expressed as </p>
<p align="center">
$P_{x}=\left(\begin{array}{l}n \\ x\end{array}\right) p^{x} q^{n-x}$ 
</p>

<p>where $P$ represents the binomial probability. In our case, we are interested in determining the average number of entries required to obtain a single six-star unit, so $x$ is set to 1. The probability of success on a single entry $p$ is 2%, while the probability of failure $q$ is 98%. The number of trials $n$ is confined to the range of 1 to 50, as we are focusing on the 1st to 50th entries exclusively. By defining all these variables, we have completed the formulation of our binomial distribution equation:</p>
<p align="center">
$P_{x}=\left(\begin{array}{l}n \\ x\end{array}\right) \times 0.02 \times 0.98^{n-1}, \quad 1 \leq n \leq 50$ 
</p>

<p>Simplifying to the equation: </p>
<p align="center">
$P_{1 \text { six star }}=\mathrm{n} \times 0.02 \times 0.98^{n-1}, \quad 1 \leq n \leq 50$
</p>

<p>However, $P$ in the binomial distribution equation represents the probability of obtaining a six-star unit within any of the $n$ trials. This is not aligned with our objective, as we are specifically interested in the probability of obtaining a six-star unit at the $n$ th entry alone, assuming all previous entries have failed. The order of selection is crucial here because our calculation concludes as soon as we secure a single six-star unit. Consequently, we need to adjust our equation by dividing it by $n$ to account for only one combination being considered:</p>
<p align="center">
$P_{1 \text { six star on the nth entry only }}=\mathrm{n} \div \mathrm{n} \times 0.02 \times 0.98^{n-1}, \quad 1 \leq n \leq 50$
</p>

<p>By simplifying and expressing the equation as a function, we obtain:</p>
<p align="center">
$P(n)=0.02 \times 0.98^{n-1}, \quad 1 \leq n \leq 50$
</p>

<h2 id="Modeling-the-51st-to-99th-Entry"><a href="#Modeling-the-51st-to-99th-Entry" class="headerlink" title="Modeling the 51st to 99th Entry"></a>Modeling the 51st to 99th Entry</h2><p>For the 51st to 99th entry, our success rate progressively increases by 2% per entry. This means that the 51st entry has a 4% success rate, the 52nd entry has a 6% success rate, and so on, until reaching the 99th entry with a success rate of 100%.</p>
<p>Since the success rate is no longer fixed, we need to transition away from using the binomial distribution as our model. Given my limited knowledge and unfamiliarity with any theorems regarding scenarios with changing probabilities, it is evident that we need to devise our own function to effectively model this situation. </p>
<p>Considering the fixed increase in success rate, it is highly probable that there exists a discernible relationship when evaluating the probability of each individual entry. As the success rate remains fixed on an individual entry basis, we can effectively employ the binomial distribution to calculate the probability of obtaining a six-star unit with each entry.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the 51st entry. Referring to our function for the 1st to 50th entry, our $x$ value along with our number of combinations remains constant. Our probability of success $p$ will be set to 4% as mentioned before. However, our probability of failure $q$ will not be set to 96%. If we set $q$ to 96%, we are stating that the probability of failure for all entries before 51st is 96%, which is not true. Referring to our binomial function for the 1st to 50th entry $P(n)&#x3D;$ $0.02 \times 0.98^{n-1}$, we notice that we only apply our failure probability for $n-1$ entries. Applying the same concept for the 51st term, we are only concerned with the probability of failure for the 1st to 50th term. Since the probability of failure is constant for the 1st to 50th term, our probability of failure component of the 51st entry is $0.98^{50}$. After defining all our variables, our equation of the 51st entry is complete:</p>
<p align="center">
$P(51)=0.04 \times 0.98^{50}$
</p>

<p>Moving on to the 52nd term, the probability of success increases to 6%. As for the probability of failure, we apply the same principle of calculating it only for the $n-1$ entries. Consequently, we arrive at a value of 0.96 multiplied by $0.98^{50}$. The 0.96 represents the probability of failure for the 51st entry, while $0.98^{50}$ refers to the probability of failure for the 1st to 50th entries. With all variables defined, the equation for the 52nd entry is now complete:</p>
<p align="center">
$P(52)=0.06 \times 0.96 \times 0.98^{50}$
</p>

<p>Following the same procedure: </p>
<p align="center">
$P(53)=0.08 \times 0.94 \times 0.96 \times 0.98^{50}$ <br>  
$P(54)=0.10 \times 0.92 \times 0.94 \times 0.96 \times 0.98^{50}$ <br>
$P(55)=0.12 \times 0.90 \times 0.92 \times 0.94 \times 0.96 \times 0.98^{50}$ <br> 
··· <br>	
$P(98)=0.98 \times 0.04 \times 0.06 \times \ldots \times 0.94 \times 0.96 \times 0.98^{50}$ <br>
$P(99)=1 \times 0.02 \times 0.04 \times 0.06 \times \ldots \times 0.94 \times 0.96 \times 0.98^{50}$ <br>
</p>

<p>From the derived equations, we can extract the probability of success component as follows:</p>
<p align="center">
$(0.02+0.02(n-50)), \quad 51 \leq n \leq 99$
</p>

<p>Simplifying to: </p>
<p align="center">
$0.02(n-49), \quad 51 \leq n \leq 99$
</p>

<p>The probability of failure component can be expressed as a product of an arithmetic series, where the probability of failure decreases by 0.02 for each subsequent entry. Following the formula for the product of an arithmetic series:</p>
<p align="center">
$\prod_{k=0}^{n-1}\left(c_{1}-k d\right)$
</p>

<p>Here, $n$ represents the number of entries, $c1$ is the first term, and $d$ is the common difference. In our case, $k$ will be 51 since our function starts from the 51st entry, $c_{1}$ will be 0.98, and $𝑑$ will be -0.02. Therefore, the probability of failure component in our function is derived as:</p>
<p align="center">
$\prod_{k=51}^{n-1}(0.98-0.02(k-50)), \quad 50<n \leq 99$
</p>

<p>The notation $k − 50$ indicates that we are treating the 51st entry as the first entry in our equation for the 51st to 99th entries. This notation can be simplified as follows:</p>
<p align="center">
$\prod_{k=51}^{n-1}(1.98-0.02 k), \quad 50<n \leq 99$
</p>

<p>Combining each component, we can arrive at the final form of our function for the 51st to 99th entries:</p>
<p align="center">
$P(n)=0.02(n-49) \times 0.98^{50} \times \prod_{k=51}^{n-1}(1.98-0.02 k), \quad 50<n \leq 99$
</p>
    
<p>It is important to note that the power notation is structured in a way that for the 51st entry, the initial entry is 51, and the number of entries is 50. This arrangement results in a value of 1, which is intentionally set up as our probability of failure component for the 51st entry is only $0.98^{50}$.</p>
<p>With this clarification, our mathematical model is now complete:</p>
<p align="center">
$
P(n)=\left\{\begin{array}{c}
0.02 \times 0.98^{n-1}, \quad 1 \leq n \leq 50 \\
0.02(n-49) \times 0.98^{50} \times \prod_{k=51}^{n-1}(1.98-0.02 k), \quad 50<n \leq 99
\end{array}\right.

<h2 id="Graphing-the-Model"><a href="#Graphing-the-Model" class="headerlink" title="Graphing the Model"></a>Graphing the Model</h2><p>We can create a graph to provide a visual representation of the Arknights character pulling model:</p>
<p><img src="/img/in-post/Ark-Model.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload alt="img"></p>
<p>This graph demonstrates the probability of obtaining a six-star unit on the $n^{th}$ entry. Examining the graph, we observe that the initial probability of obtaining a six-star is 2%, which serves as our base probability. As subsequent entries are considered, the probability gradually decreases. This decline is expected, as it indicates that all previous entries leading up to the successful pull were unsuccessful. The downward trend persists until the 50th entry, where the probability reaches 0.74%. </p>
<p>At the 51st entry, the pity system activates, resulting in an upward slope. This upward slope indicates that the pity system is functioning as intended, offering higher probabilities for obtaining a six-star unit. The peak probability of 3.35% occurs at the 56th entry. Following this peak, the probability gradually declines, reflecting the impact of the pity system and previous successful entries. </p>
<p>Notably, reaching the 99th entry without obtaining a six-star unit is highly unlikely, with a probability close to 0. Conclusively, most players will achieve success before reaching the later stages of the character pulling system. However, it’s worth noting that the 56th entry, despite having the highest probability, <strong>does not</strong> represent the average entry point we are seeking.</p>
<h2 id="Solution-1-Cumulative-Probability"><a href="#Solution-1-Cumulative-Probability" class="headerlink" title="Solution 1: Cumulative Probability"></a>Solution 1: Cumulative Probability</h2><p>One approach to determining the average number of entries required to obtain one six-star unit is to calculate the cumulative probability based on the aforementioned model. The cumulative probability at 50% can serve as an indicator of the average entry, as it signifies that half of the player base has already achieved success in obtaining one six-star unit.</p>
<p>Using sigma notation to compute the cumulative probability, we obtain:</p>
<p align="center">
$\text { Cumulative Probability }=\sum_{i=1}^{n} P(i), \quad 1 \leq n \leq 99$
</p>

<p>Graphically representing this equation provides further clarity:<br><img src="/img/in-post/Ark-Cumu-Model.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload alt="img"></p>
<p>Upon analyzing the graph, it becomes evident that the cumulative probability reaches 100% at the 99th entry, affirming the accuracy of our equation and model. This validates that the individual probabilities for each entry were calculated correctly, resulting in a cumulative sum of 100%. </p>
<p>Additionally, the slope of the graph increases notably after the 50th entry, indicating a higher rate of players successfully obtaining a six-star unit due to the implementation of the pity system.</p>
<p>At the <strong>35th entry</strong>, the cumulative probability stands at 50.69%. This figure represents the average number of entries required with 50% denoting the point at which half of the player base is expected to have achieved success in obtaining a six-star unit.</p>
<h2 id="Solution-2-Expected-Values"><a href="#Solution-2-Expected-Values" class="headerlink" title="Solution 2: Expected Values"></a>Solution 2: Expected Values</h2><p>Another approach to determine the average entry is by calculating the expected values, which represent the mean of a probability distribution. For our case of pulling one six-star unit, we can apply the expected value formula. Considering a random variable $X$ with possible entries $e_{1}, e_{2}, e_{3}, \ldots, e_{n}$ and associated probabilities $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \ldots, a_{n}$, the expected value of $X$ is given by:</p>
<p align="center">
$E(X)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(e_{i} \times a_{i}\right)$
</p>

<p>To calculate the expected value of pulling one six-star unit, we set $e_{i}$ as $i$, since the number of entries corresponds to the number of trials. The $a_{i}$ values are set as $P(n)$, representing the probability of obtaining one six-star unit for each individual trial. The total number of trials $n$ is set to 99. Therefore, the equation becomes:</p>
<p align="center">
$E(\text { Pulling } 1 \text { Six Star })=\sum_{i=1}^{99}(i \times P(i))$
</p>

<p>Solving this equation yields the result:</p>
<p align="center">
$E(\text { Pulling } 1 \text { Six Star })=34.59$
</p>

<p>Hence, the average number of entries required to obtain one six-star unit is approximately <strong>34.59 pulls</strong>. This outcome aligns with our cumulative graph, falling between the 34th entry at 49.69% and the 35th entry at 50.69%.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Both solutions lead to similar conclusion (<strong>34.59%</strong>), which aligns with the cumulative probability graph reaching 100%, as well as other methods like the previously mentioned <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rpubs.com/zyLiu6707/arknights-pull-simulation">Monte Carlo approach</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rpubs.com/Frizu/arknightsgacha">code simulations</a>.</p>
<p>Taking 35 as the average entry, since entries are whole numbers, and considering each entry has a cost of 600 Orundum, the average cost of obtaining a six-star unit is 600 × 35 &#x3D; <strong>21,000 Orundum</strong>.</p>
<p>Additionally, I have created an <strong>Arknights Pull Quantile</strong> table:</p>
<p><img src="/img/in-post/Ark-Quantile.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload alt="img"></p>
<p align="center">
The Arknights Pull Quantile
</p>

<p>Using this table, I can determine my “luckiness” based on the number of entries. For example, in the IL Siracusano Event Banner,  where I obtained a six-star unit (Texalter) in 26 rolls, I am ranked in the top 40.86% within the player base. This means that I am luckier than approximately 60% of the gamer population. :)</p>
<h2 id="Evaluations-and-Extensions"><a href="#Evaluations-and-Extensions" class="headerlink" title="Evaluations and Extensions"></a>Evaluations and Extensions</h2><p>The process of finding relationships between individual entries and solving the complex probability problem unfolded as expected. The presented models accurately illustrate the binomial outcome and cumulative probability in obtaining a six-star unit. </p>
<p>However, I made several mistakes regarding the probability of failure component during the process. It was only when I graphed the cumulative probability that I realized something was amiss. Through multiple iterations and edits, I eventually reached a cumulative probability of 100%. Each adjustment allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the binomial distribution and the contributions of each component in arriving at the solution.</p>
<p>This investigation can be extended in various directions. Firstly, exploring additional methods to calculate average entry amounts would be valuable. For example, incorporating the Markov property, which accounts for the dependence of a certain entry’s probability on the outcomes of previous entries, could offer an intriguing alternative for determining the average entry.</p>
<p>Another potential extension involves calculating the binomial probability of obtaining a specific six-star unit instead of any six star. This can be achieved by multiplying the binomial probability of receiving any six-star unit with the specific probability of obtaining the desired character. Expanding further in this direction, it would be interesting to determine the average number of entries required to obtain two copies of the same six-star unit. </p>
<p>This analysis could provide valuable insights to the Arknights gaming community by predicting the number of entries necessary to acquire multiple copies of a specific six-star unit, which in turn enhances the unit’s power level.</p>
<p>These extensions would contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the Arknights character pulling system and offer valuable insights for players seeking to optimize their strategies.</p>
