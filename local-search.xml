    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>This article reflects on my life from the week of <code>07-15-2024</code> to <code>07-21-2024</code>.</p></blockquote><p>I‚Äôve been slowly improving my study habits this week. I also started¬†<a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/">CS50</a>¬†to refresh my knowledge of C, which I realized I had forgotten after taking my last C course, CPSC 259, a year ago. Once I finish the course, I should grind some LeetCode to better prepare for interviews.</p><h3 id="Finding-Joy-in-Engineering-Again"><a href="#Finding-Joy-in-Engineering-Again" class="headerlink" title="Finding Joy in Engineering Again"></a>Finding Joy in Engineering Again</h3><p>Second year of engineering was a challenging period. Despite cool projects such as the¬†<a href="https://github.com/Shengw3n/FPGA-Reduced-Instruction-Set-Computer">FPGA RISC Machine</a>,¬†<a href="https://github.com/Shengw3n/Reflow-Oven-Controller">Reflow Oven Controller</a>, and¬†<a href="https://github.com/Shengw3n/Remote-Controlled-Metal-Detector-Robot">Remote-Controlled Robot</a>, the experience felt rushed and lacked the joy I once associated with engineering. Long lab hours and unending assignments made it a tough year overall.</p><p><img src="/img/in-post/IMG_0689.jpeg" alt="Me and my ELEC 291 group getting A&amp;W at 6 am after an all-nighter"></p><p>The turning point came this week with my <a href="https://shengw3n.github.io/2024/07/22/Weekly_Report_3/#UBC-Rocket">involvements</a> in¬†UBC Rocket. Successfully setting up Wi-Fi communication for the Thrust Vector Rocket brought back the excitement I had been missing. The sense of accomplishment when establishing a working connection was exhilarating, especially after analyzing the network protocol like a spy beforehand. Moving forward, I aim to seek out and cherish more of these fulfilling moments.</p><h3 id="UBC-Rocket"><a href="#UBC-Rocket" class="headerlink" title="UBC Rocket"></a>UBC Rocket</h3><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.ubcrocket.com/">UBC Rocket</a> is an engineering student design team at the University of British Columbia dedicated to the design, manufacture, and launch of suborbital rockets. I‚Äôm currently contributing to the¬†<a href="https://github.com/UBC-Rocket/Thrust-Vectoring">Thrust Vector Rocket</a>, our self-landing rocket project.</p></blockquote><p>We are still waiting for the new ESC installation to start tuning the PID. In the meantime, I implemented a Wi-Fi communication using a custom-made ESP-12F I had at home.</p><h4 id="Wi-Fi-Station-Communication"><a href="#Wi-Fi-Station-Communication" class="headerlink" title="Wi-Fi Station Communication"></a>Wi-Fi Station Communication</h4><p>It turns out the custom-made ESP-12F is designed for children aged 3-12 in China and is highly specialized, connecting only to a dedicated Android app and WeChat, with limited customization. It is also impossible to code the ESP-12F since it is soldered onto a custom PCB board. I managed to establish communication with the Android app using a MacBook android simulator, but the app itself is again very basic and lacks customization.</p><p>I considered giving up and buying a cheap Bluetooth Low Energy module instead (which we might do next year), but I decided to reverse engineer the communication protocol between the ESP-12F and the Android app first using a network analyzer tool like¬†<a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a>.</p><p><img src="/img/in-post/IMG_1234.png" alt="Analyzing network protocol using Wireshark"></p><p>Of course I had to first spend a day learning network concepts (<a href="https://tttapa.github.io/ESP8266/Chap01%20-%20ESP8266.html">this website</a> was particularly helpful), but in the end I managed to reverse-engineer the communication protocol and incorporated it into the code. </p><h4 id="Python-Code-Snippet"><a href="#Python-Code-Snippet" class="headerlink" title="Python Code Snippet"></a>Python Code Snippet</h4><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="hljs Python"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">send_command</span>(<span class="hljs-params">command</span>): <span class="hljs-comment"># Function to send command to ESP-12F</span><br>    host = <span class="hljs-string">&#x27;192.168.1.1&#x27;</span><br>    port = <span class="hljs-number">2001</span><br><br>    <span class="hljs-keyword">try</span>:<br>        <span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> s:<br>            s.connect((host, port))<br>            s.sendall((command + <span class="hljs-string">&#x27;\n&#x27;</span>).encode())<br></code></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>I also created a neat GUI with¬†<code>tkinter</code>, allowing us to remotely control the rocket with style üòé:<br><img src="/img/in-post/gui.png" alt="Simple Rocket Control GUI"><br>However, it is still impossible to send sensor data back from the rocket through the ESP-12F since I cannot code it. I am essentially mimicking the Android app. This functionality is sufficient for the Launch Canada Competition in a month, where we are showcasing the hover ability of our Thrust Vector Rocket instead of flying it. We will likely switch to Bluetooth or a radio module like the Xbee next year.</p><h4 id="Baidu-Netdisk-Rant"><a href="#Baidu-Netdisk-Rant" class="headerlink" title="Baidu Netdisk Rant"></a>Baidu Netdisk Rant</h4><p>I tried to download a data sheet for the custom ESP-12F, which was stored on Baidu Netdisk, the Chinese equivalent of Google Drive. The experience was terrible.</p><p>Instead of downloading from browser, a desktop app is required, which opens with unavoidable 5-second ads, is bloated with random functions, and has an incredibly slow download speed despite having great Wi-Fi connection. Consistently getting sub 150 KB&#x2F;s in 2024 is absurd. It took a day to download 4 GB. (I later found out you need to buy VIP to unlock high speed download.)</p><p><img src="/img/in-post/baidu.png" alt="Baidu Netdisk Downloading Speed"></p><p>The ‚Äúdatasheet‚Äù turned out to be 4 GB of an Android app APK and a 720p video explaining the product, with no actual data sheet. This experience, along with the terrible documentation for the JP Hobby ESC, emphasized the importance of providing detailed documentation to consumers. I vow to provide such for my future products to avoid such frustrations.</p><h3 id="First-Time-going-to-the-Casino"><a href="#First-Time-going-to-the-Casino" class="headerlink" title="First Time going to the Casino"></a>First Time going to the Casino</h3><p>My friends recently all started going to the casino to play poker for some reason. I decided to tag along one night to see what‚Äôs up. I ended up losing $50 while a friend lost $150. The only person who made a profit (+$72) had lost $100 the previous day, so it doesn‚Äôt even count. What was alarming was that my first thought after losing $50 (despite having no job) was to watch poker videos and to watch Poker videos and comeback to play again. Thankfully, once I got home and my adrenaline lowered, I realized how dangerous this mentality was and decided to avoid the casino in the future. (My friends went back the next day; they desperately need help üôè)</p><p><img src="/img/in-post/IMG_1498.jpeg" alt="Heading to the casino"></p><h3 id="Hitting-Silver-in-League"><a href="#Hitting-Silver-in-League" class="headerlink" title="Hitting Silver in League"></a>Hitting Silver in League</h3><p>Besides the degen casino trip, I also managed to climb to Silver this week in League of Legends! (I uninstalled the same day, too much brain rot activities, I am pretty happy with silver)</p><p><img src="/img/in-post/leagueoflegend.png" alt="I hit silver!"></p>]]></content>

    <title>WR#2 - Busy week</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>This article reflects on my life from the week of <code>07-08-2024</code> to <code>07-14-2024</code>.</p></blockquote><p>Busy and tiring week. Following my first weekly report, I‚Äôve been working on building discipline by committing to daily planned tasks. Although I‚Äôve made some progress, I still find myself spending a fair amount of time watching Bilibili and reading manga. It‚Äôs a gradual process, but I‚Äôm happy with the improvements I‚Äôm seeing.</p><h3 id="UBC-Rockets"><a href="#UBC-Rockets" class="headerlink" title="UBC Rockets"></a>UBC Rockets</h3><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.ubcrocket.com/">UBC Rocket</a> is an engineering student design team at the University of British Columbia dedicated to the design, manufacture, and launch of suborbital rockets. I‚Äôm currently contributing to the¬†<a href="https://github.com/UBC-Rocket/Thrust-Vectoring">Thrust Vector Rocket</a>, our self-landing rocket project.</p></blockquote><p>This week, my teammate and I made a super stupid mistake by frying the ESC (Electric Speed Controller) for our rocket. The issue arose because our rocket‚Äôs thrust was consistently below the expected 9kg, hovering around 4kg. After much troubleshooting, we concluded the problem was likely with the power supply rather than the code. In our haste to resolve the issue, we rewired the circuit, but ended up doubling the voltage beyond the engine‚Äôs acceptable range, which destroyed the ESC.</p><p>This experience was a tough lesson in patience and thoroughness. Our haste prevented us from properly reviewing the circuit before testing. Moving forward, we need to ensure high-voltage circuits are reviewed carefully to avoid such mistakes.</p><h4 id="Launch-Canada-Final-Report"><a href="#Launch-Canada-Final-Report" class="headerlink" title="Launch Canada Final Report"></a>Launch Canada Final Report</h4><p>We (3 people) completed a 37-page technical report in one day for the Launch Canada competition. Horrendous experience that I do not want to go through again. I aspire to write it better next year.</p><h4 id="Software-Progress"><a href="#Software-Progress" class="headerlink" title="Software Progress"></a>Software Progress</h4><p>This week I processed the gyroscope and accelerometer data using a Kalman filter and fed the resulting angle data into the PID controller. This marks significant progress towards the hover functionality we plan to showcase at the Launch Canada competition in August. You can see the gimbal reacting to the sensor‚Äôs data below.</p><p>In terms of simulation, after consulting with fellow rocket member <a href="https://timothycai.com/">Timothy</a>, we decided to forgo creating a Matlab model and instead use the Ziegler-Nichols method for in the loop PID tuning. This seems like a more practical approach.</p><h4 id="Gimbal-PID-Testing"><a href="#Gimbal-PID-Testing" class="headerlink" title="Gimbal PID Testing"></a>Gimbal PID Testing</h4><div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 75%;"><iframe src="/vid/IMG_6815.MOV" alt="Gimbal PID Testing" scrolling="no" border="0" frameborder="no" framespacing="0" allowfullscreen="true" style="position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; left: 0; top: 0;"> </iframe></div><h4 id="Next-Steps"><a href="#Next-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Next Steps"></a>Next Steps</h4><ul><li>Design and manufacture test rig for PID tuning</li><li>Implement wireless functionalities</li></ul><h3 id="Nanaimo-Oysters-Harvesting-Trip"><a href="#Nanaimo-Oysters-Harvesting-Trip" class="headerlink" title="Nanaimo Oysters Harvesting Trip"></a>Nanaimo Oysters Harvesting Trip</h3><p>On Tuesday, I purchased a one-day fishing license and took a boat trip to Nanaimo for oyster harvesting. It was my first time and the beach was covered in oysters ‚Äî a rewarding experience! No photos during harvesting cuz my hand was dirty.</p><div class="group-image-container"><div class="group-image-row"><div class="group-image-wrap"><img src="/img/in-post/DSCF3429.jpeg"></div><div class="group-image-wrap"><img src="/img/in-post/DSCF3204.jpeg"></div><div class="group-image-wrap"><img src="/img/in-post/DSCF3304.jpeg"></div></div><div class="group-image-row"><div class="group-image-wrap"><img src="/img/in-post/DSCF3425.jpeg"></div><div class="group-image-wrap"><img src="/img/in-post/DSCF3115.jpeg"></div></div></div>]]></content>

    <title>WR#1 - Reflections on Ambition and Motivation</title>
    <link href="/2024/07/08/Weekly_Report_1/"/>
    <url>/2024/07/08/Weekly_Report_1/</url>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>This article reflects on my life from the week of <code>07-01-2024</code> to <code>07-07-2024</code>.</p></blockquote><p>Over the past two years at university, my busy schedule and various distractions have diminished my time for independent thinking, impacting my study efficiency and motivation. Watching my GPA decline each semester and feeling increasingly distanced from my ideal self, I realized I faced a crucial decision: continue on my current path or make a change.</p><p>The idea of writing weekly reports began about six months ago after discovering¬†<a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/zh/">pseudoyu</a>‚Äôs blog. I aim to evaluate my life, work, and studies weekly, much like his approach. Writing these reports is my way of motivating myself to get closer to who I want to become.</p><h3 id="Dreams-Discipline-and-the-Pain-of-Failure"><a href="#Dreams-Discipline-and-the-Pain-of-Failure" class="headerlink" title="Dreams, Discipline, and the Pain of Failure"></a>Dreams, Discipline, and the Pain of Failure</h3><p>Fencing has been a bittersweet journey for me. Since I was 12, my dream was to join the Canadian national team for fencing. I invested significant time and money, fenced almost daily, attended numerous competitions, and trained diligently. Despite these efforts, I did not achieve my goal.</p><p>Reconciling with myself has been difficult, especially when surrounded by talented individuals. A friend who began fencing just six months before me is heading to the Paris Olympics, while others a year older and younger have made the national team. Although one could argue that the pandemic disrupted my schedule, I ultimately hold myself accountable.</p><p>I need to understand what I lack compared to my successful peers. I‚Äôve identified two major deficiencies: discipline and a strong desire to win.</p><p>Firstly, I struggle with discipline. Although I showed dedication at the fencing strip, I lacked the consistency needed for additional training and overall fitness improvement. This lack of discipline also affects my academic work, where my efforts are sporadic and lack sustained focus.</p><p>Secondly, my desire to win isn‚Äôt as strong as it should be. This paradox is evident both in fencing and my studies. While I enjoy fencing and the idea of being on the national team, I don‚Äôt display the intense determination necessary for success. My reaction to wins or losses is subdued, and similarly, while I prefer high exam scores, I‚Äôm not deeply affected by low ones. This discrepancy between my aspirations and reality is a significant source of frustration.</p><h3 id="Adapting-to-Present-Challenges"><a href="#Adapting-to-Present-Challenges" class="headerlink" title="Adapting to Present Challenges"></a>Adapting to Present Challenges</h3><p>My dreams have deep roots in my childhood and remain consistent. Beyond fencing, I also aspired to become an engineer from a young age, inspired by the giant robots in animes like ‚ÄúCode Geass‚Äù and ‚ÄúGundam 00.‚Äù I even shared my Gundam ambitions during my first-year Engineering Physics interview, a moment that now makes me smile with embarrassment.</p><p>After the setback of my fencing dream, I‚Äôve approached my engineering aspirations with increased caution. As I‚Äôve grown older, anxiety and fear have intensified. Rejections from job interviews, unsatisfactory exam results, and failed engineering projects have made me restless, undermining my focus on current goals. As my sense of security gradually peels away like a onion, loneliness has taken its place. I am slowly learning to navigate this new, isolating reality.</p><h3 id="UBC-Rockets"><a href="#UBC-Rockets" class="headerlink" title="UBC Rockets"></a>UBC Rockets</h3><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.ubcrocket.com/">UBC Rocket</a> is an engineering student design team at the University of British Columbia dedicated to the design, manufacture, and launch of suborbital rockets.

The principle is straightforward: if the rocket tilts to one side, the gimbal tilts in the opposite direction to correct it.</p><h4 id="PID-Code-Snippet"><a href="#PID-Code-Snippet" class="headerlink" title="PID Code Snippet"></a>PID Code Snippet</h4><figure class="highlight c++"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="hljs C++">inputY = a.acceleration.y; <span class="hljs-comment">// Using acceleration as input</span><br>pidY.<span class="hljs-built_in">Compute</span>();<br><span class="hljs-type">int</span> servoPosY = <span class="hljs-built_in">constrain</span>(<span class="hljs-number">90</span> + outputY, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">180</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">// outputY = PID output</span><br>servoY.<span class="hljs-built_in">write</span>(servoPosY);<br></code></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h4 id="Debugging"><a href="#Debugging" class="headerlink" title="Debugging"></a>Debugging</h4><ol><li>The gyroscope MPU-6050‚Äôs AD0 pin (I2C Address pin) was not connected to ground, causing occasional sensor freezes.</li><li>The Arduino PID Library &lt;PID_v1.h&gt; has a default output range of 0-255, which caused issues with negative PID outputs.¬†<code>SetOutputLimits()</code> resolved this.</li></ol><h4 id="Next-Steps"><a href="#Next-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Next Steps"></a>Next Steps</h4><ul><li>Combine accelerometer and gyro readings using a complementary Kalman filter for more accurate rocket angle estimation</li><li>Motor Test</li><li>Matlab simulations (?)</li></ul><h3 id="Canada-Day"><a href="#Canada-Day" class="headerlink" title="Canada Day"></a>Canada Day</h3><p>Monday was Canada Day, went to an all-you-can-eat hotpot with friends and later played some poker at the park while we wait for the fireworks.

It was a typical dark and rainy evening in Vancouver. John, my roommate, had attempted to use his air fryer to cook pork ribs when, suddenly, the entire kitchen was engulfed in darkness. The abrupt blackout sent his fridge ‚Äì the sanctuary of his beloved lemon ice creams ‚Äì into turmoil.</p><p>Now, John, not being an engineering student, immediately spiraled into a full-blown panic.

    <title>My First Engineering Internship</title>
    <link href="/2023/09/15/4-First-Internship/"/>
    <url>/2023/09/15/4-First-Internship/</url>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During the summer, I traveled back to China to visit my grandparents, marking my first return in over four years due to COVID-19 restrictions. While in China, I applied for an internship at a  local storage robotics company known as <a href="https://en.ny-zn.com/">Bullseye</a>. Bullseye specializes in designing and manufacturing storage robotics for large corporations such as Starbucks, Siemens, and Jingdong. (You can click on their website for a fascinating animation demonstrating how these robots operate.)</p><p><img src="/img/in-post/bullseye.jpg" alt="A Bullseye Storage Robotics Warehouse"></p><p>Initially, I applied for a position as an embedded engineer, but during the interview, we realized that I wouldn‚Äôt have enough time to learn the necessary skills for embedded engineering, given that I needed to return to school in September. Which is fair since I had just completed my first year of studies.</p><p>However, they offered an alternative opportunity: interning as a front-end developer. Without hesitation, I accepted their offer, read through the internship and employee policies, and signed both the internship contract and the non-disclosure agreement. And now, here I am, in my first ever cubicle.<br><img src="/img/in-post/niuyan_desk.JPG" alt="Me at my cubicle"></p><h2 id="What-I-Learned"><a href="#What-I-Learned" class="headerlink" title="What I Learned"></a>What I Learned</h2><p>Working from 8 to 5 as a front-end developer, the role involved utilizing languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vue to create user interfaces. At Bullseye, this meant designing interfaces for controlling storage robotics and providing information about warehouse occupancy, item locations, and more.</p><p>Although front-end development differs significantly from electrical engineering, I found the subject extremely engaging. The ability to present data and information in a visually pleasing manner resonated with me, and the coding skills I acquired during my internship ultimately enabled me to create and maintain this blog.</p><p>Beyond technical skills, I also gained insights into the inner workings of an engineering R&amp;D company. This environment was a stark contrast to my previous job as a fencing coach, where I was constantly surrounded by younger children. At Bullseye, the atmosphere was both serious and engaging. My colleagues were incredibly friendly, and whenever I had questions about my tasks, my manager was always there to support me. Furthermore, the human resources department was equally accommodating, always ready to address any queries I had.</p><p>In addition, due to a shortage of available cubicles in the R&amp;D department, I was assigned to sit with the sales department. Listening to their daily sales calls also provided me with an unusual but valuable experience.</p><h2 id="Monday-Morning-Meetings"><a href="#Monday-Morning-Meetings" class="headerlink" title="Monday Morning Meetings"></a>Monday Morning Meetings</h2><p>Every Monday morning, my colleagues and I would assemble in formation, much like soldiers. We‚Äôd begin by reciting the company‚Äôs goals, and our director would then go on to list the accomplishments of each department from the previous week and note any follow-up tasks. Afterward, he‚Äôd assign new tasks to each department and share major updates, such as new clients, challenges, and achievements. The meeting lasted less than 10 minutes, but it had a profound impact on everyone‚Äôs morale. Perhaps it‚Äôs a tradition in Chinese companies to infuse enthusiasm and motivation into their work culture.<br><img src="/img/in-post/morning_meeting.jpeg" alt="The Monday Meeting"></p><h2 id="The-Lunch-Breaks"><a href="#The-Lunch-Breaks" class="headerlink" title="The Lunch Breaks"></a>The Lunch Breaks</h2><p>Our lunch break commences at 12 p.m. and extends for an hour. The office was conveniently located near several restaurants, and the best part was that we received lunch subsidies. I must say, I absolutely relished dining in China.<br><img src="/img/in-post/work_lunch.jpeg" alt="Typical Lunch at Work"></p><h2 id="The-Takeaway"><a href="#The-Takeaway" class="headerlink" title="The Takeaway"></a>The Takeaway</h2><p>I‚Äôm uncertain whether I‚Äôll ever use front-end coding in my electrical engineering career, but I‚Äôm certain that without this internship, I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to create this blog. Working at an actual engineering company over the summer was an enjoyable and enlightening experience. I acquired numerous skills that are transferable to various other positions and endeavours. As the UBC Co-op office advises, seize every learning opportunity that comes your way, and your path will unfold before you.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>In the first year of engineering at UBC, all students take the same set of courses from the standard timetable (STT). In this article, I will provide a comprehensive overview of each course, including its contents, difficulties, and potential challenges.</p></blockquote><p>Typically, your semester will follow a structure similar to the one outlined below, although some Standard Timetable (STT) variations may interchange PHYS 170 and APSC 160. It is recommended to aim to take APSC 160 in the first semester and PHYS 170 in the second semester as indicated here. This is because Math 152, which is only offered in semester 2, helps you learn PHYS 170 contents better; and the coding skills learned in APSC 160 are useful in designing your claw for APSC 101 in term 2. </p><p><strong>Note:</strong>  Most people take an English course (typically WRDS 150) and an arts elective during the first year. They are not included here because I had credits so I just skipped them. </p><p><strong>Another Note:</strong> This is my experience taking first-year courses in the 2022-2023 year. Please note that curriculum changes can occur over time, and the specific courses you will take may vary based on the academic year you are in. For example, in our year, there were significant modifications in Math 100 and Math 101 compared to previous years. Therefore, it is essential to have a look at the most up-to-date curriculum and course offerings for accurate information about your specific academic year.</p><h2 id="General-Advice"><a href="#General-Advice" class="headerlink" title="General Advice"></a>General Advice</h2><p>I took IB Math HL and IB Physics HL so I learned a lot of content prior. The biggest jump for me is the amount of homework for every class. Sometimes it for real feels like there‚Äôs no time to study because we are just doing homework all day. Try not to skip every class like me and build a strong foundation throughout the year rather than cramming before exams.  The content is not hard in my opinion, there‚Äôs just a lot of content to cover in a relatively short amount of time.  Use <a href="https://ubcgrades.com/">UBCGrades</a> to check the averages for your classes to get a good understanding of the difficulty levels.</p><p>In addition, good exam-taking skills are also vital. You need to be both fast and accurate, especially during midterms when exam times are very short. In my experience, UBC doesn‚Äôt give that many part marks for incorrect answers. </p><h2 id="Semester-1"><a href="#Semester-1" class="headerlink" title="Semester 1"></a>Semester 1</h2><h3 id="Math-100"><a href="#Math-100" class="headerlink" title="Math 100"></a>Math 100</h3><p><em>Difficulty: ‚≠ê</em> </p><p>Math 100 teaches you how to do derivatives along with a little bit of optimization and multivariable calculus. If you did IB or AP like me this is essentially a review. Contents are much easier too. The multivariable calculus part was super hard and teaches you about saddle points, Newton‚Äôs law of cooling, and crazy year 2 math, but none of it showed up on any exams. </p><ul><li>Resources:<ul><li><a href="https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~CLP/CLP1/">Textbook</a></li><li><a href="https://secure.math.ubc.ca/Ugrad/pastExams/">Past Exams</a></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><p>Workload:</p><ul><li>Weekly math questions</li><li>2 practice exams for participation marks</li><li>5 written group assignments</li></ul></li><li><p>Exams:</p><ul><li>Only 1 final worth 50%, consisting of 10 easy questions and 3-4 hard questions. Many questions were pretty similar to assignments and past exams.</li></ul></li><li><p>Study Recommendations:</p><ul><li>Make sure you can do the weekly math questions with ease.</li><li>Grind past&#x2F;practice exams and review group assignments prior to finals.</li><li>Group assignments are worth 20% of your final grade and they mark it very harshly. Make sure someone in your group knows latex.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="APSC-100-101"><a href="#APSC-100-101" class="headerlink" title="APSC 100&#x2F;101"></a>APSC 100&#x2F;101</h3><p><em>Difficulty: ‚≠ê‚≠ê</em> </p><p>APSC 100 in term 1, and APSC 101 in term 2. They are meme courses that teach you the roles and responsibilities of an engineer and what an engineering design process might look like. You also gain hands-on experience designing cardboard chairs, autonomous claws, etc. It is a meme course because the exams are multiple choices only and all of the choices make sense. So at the end of the day, it‚Äôs essentially a test on reading comprehension. You‚Äôll know what I‚Äôm talking about when you actually experience it yourself.</p><ul><li><p>Workload:</p><ul><li>Weekly screencast and online quizzes</li><li>Monthly engineering projects (Cardboard chair competition, bike lane design presentations, etc.)<ul><li>Some engineering projects, notably the Rainwater Treatment System in APSC 101, take a really long time to complete. It all depends on how helpful your teammates are.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Exams:</p><ul><li>1 midterm and 1 final,  all multiple-choice. I have gotten better marks not studying than studying. Just make sure your reading comprehension is on point. They scale the exams really hard.</li></ul></li><li><p>Study Recommendations:</p><ul><li>Watch the weekly modules carefully and do a couple of practice exams prior to exams. A good night‚Äôs sleep and not overthinking is sometimes more important.  A lot of it is honestly common sense. </li><li>Taking initiative in team management and keeping your group organized is very important because the deadline for projects is often alongside midterms for your other classes and stress can quickly build up.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="CHEM-154"><a href="#CHEM-154" class="headerlink" title="CHEM 154"></a>CHEM 154</h3><p><em>Difficulty: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê</em> </p><p>CHEM 154 is essentially Chemistry 12 on steroids. You learn some stoichiometry in the beginning and slowly transition to equilibriums, thermodynamics, kinetics, and electrochemistry.  I am not very good at chemistry nor am I interested so the course felt very hard&#x2F;tedious for me. Each unit by itself isn‚Äôt hard at all but there are just too many units.</p><ul><li><p>Workload:</p><ul><li>Weekly workbook questions</li><li>monthly lab writeup</li></ul></li><li><p>Exams:</p><ul><li>1 midterm and 1 final, some short answer questions and some long answers.</li></ul></li><li><p>Study Recommendations:</p><ul><li>Begin your studies early, complete all workbook questions, and ensure a thorough understanding of the material after reviewing the answers.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="PHYS-157"><a href="#PHYS-157" class="headerlink" title="PHYS 157"></a>PHYS 157</h3><p><em>Difficulty: ‚≠ê‚≠ê</em> </p><p>Physics 157 teaches you about thermodynamics and waves and will be your first university-level physics. You will learn that a heat engine is the exact opposite of a refrigerator and how waves can be used to measure space compressions. Honestly, the hardness deserves a ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê but this insane <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLODFGtnlvFGdAWq9H3Y6UjyKqCwn6FzoG">YouTube playlist</a> exists. Professor Raamsdonk is the goat.</p><ul><li><p>Workload:</p><ul><li>Weekly reading quiz</li><li>Weekly online Mastering Physics questions or written worksheets</li></ul></li><li><p>Exams:</p><ul><li>2 midterms and 1 final consisting of some multiple-choice and some written questions. Multiple choices are worth a lot of marks and if you mess up just one you lose like 6% on the midterm. The final was pretty light though and perhaps that‚Äôs why our average this year was the highest compared to past years.</li></ul></li><li><p>Study Recommendations:</p><ul><li>Watch Professor Raamsdonk ‚Äôs YouTube and fully understand it</li><li>Make sure you do all the Mastering Physics questions by yourself, it‚Äôs only worth a few percentages it‚Äôs much more beneficial to mess up now than during the exams.</li><li>Grind practice and past midterms</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="APSC-160"><a href="#APSC-160" class="headerlink" title="APSC 160"></a>APSC 160</h3><p><em>Difficulty: ‚≠ê</em> </p><p>Definitely the most enjoyable course in the first term. APSC 160 teaches you how to code in C and is the only flipped classroom in the first year (you learn the material at home and the professor goes over the main points in class).  You do not need prior coding experiences to exceed in this course and watching your code run for the first time can be very exciting. Most of the class time is used for homework which means you have minimal workload at home and you can leave class fairly early once you finish.</p><ul><li><p>Workload:</p><ul><li>Weekly screencast and coding assignments</li></ul></li><li><p>Exams:</p><ul><li>2 midterms and 1 final. The first midterm was easy, the second midterm was hard, and the final was easy. Just make sure you can write code fast because the exam is a bit tight on time.</li></ul></li><li><p>Study Recommendations:</p><ul><li>Watch the screencast and do the code assignments on time and by yourself.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="Semester-2"><a href="#Semester-2" class="headerlink" title="Semester 2"></a>Semester 2</h2><h3 id="Math-101"><a href="#Math-101" class="headerlink" title="Math 101"></a>Math 101</h3><p><em>Difficulty: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê</em> </p><p>Math 101 teaches you how to do integration for the first half of the course and series for the second half. The integration part was a review from IB but definitely not the series part. </p><ul><li>Resources:<ul><li><a href="https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~CLP/CLP2/">Textbook</a></li><li><a href="https://secure.math.ubc.ca/Ugrad/pastExams/">Past Exams</a></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><p>Workload:</p><ul><li>Weekly math questions</li><li>2 practice exams for participation marks</li><li>5 written group assignments</li></ul></li><li><p>Exams:</p><ul><li>No midterms and 1 final worth 50%, consisting of 10 easy questions and 3-4 hard questions. The past exams were not very useful given the large amount of curriculum change this year.</li></ul></li></ul><p> Study Recommendations:<br>    - Same as MATH 100<br>     - Math 101 has less overlap with high school material compared to Math 100, so it‚Äôs beneficial to practice with CLP 2 questions for additional preparation.</p><h3 id="Math-152"><a href="#Math-152" class="headerlink" title="Math 152"></a>Math 152</h3><p><em>Difficulty: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê</em> </p><p>Math 152 teaches you linear systems, which is very important in understanding PHYS 170 and ultimately mechanics. The first half consisted of vectors and matrices and was much easier than IB Math HL. The second half consists of eigenvalues and matrix algebra which are all difficult conceptually.  You also learn Matlab basics throughout the course. If you have not studied vectors and planes before I suggest you start learning a bit prior to the start of the course, especially if you are not good at imagining 3D planes. A lot of my friends had trouble understanding at first.</p><ul><li><p>Resources:</p><ul><li><a href="https://secure.math.ubc.ca/Ugrad/pastExams/">Past Exams</a></li></ul></li><li><p>Workload:</p><ul><li>Weekly math questions</li><li>Bi-weekly MATLAB labs</li></ul></li><li><p>Exams:</p><ul><li>2 midterm and 1 final. The midterms were ok but the final was super super super hard.</li></ul></li><li><p>Study Recommendations:</p><ul><li>Same as MATH 100</li><li>Review your exam markings. There are many different methods of solving linear systems and your TA marking may not be aware of your methods.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="PHYS-158"><a href="#PHYS-158" class="headerlink" title="PHYS 158"></a>PHYS 158</h3><p><em>Difficulty: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê</em> </p><p>The hardest course in the first year.  PHYS 158 teaches you circuits and magnetism. There are <strong>a lot</strong> of contents and none of them are easy, so definitely start studying early.  Even if you did horrible on your first 2 midterms, don‚Äôt give up because if you did well in the final the professor replaces your final course grade with your final exam grade. (<strong>Note</strong>: this is true for my year I‚Äôm not sure about yours)</p><ul><li><p>Resources:</p><ul><li>Watch this goated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MichelvanBiezen/featured">Youtube Channel</a> on any topic you don‚Äôt understand</li></ul></li><li><p>Workload:</p><ul><li>Weekly reading quiz</li><li>Weekly Mastering Physics or Written Homework</li></ul></li><li><p>Exams: </p><ul><li>2 midterms and 1 final they are all very brutal</li></ul></li><li><p>Study Recommendation:</p><ul><li>Learn material early and fully understand mastering physics and written homework problems. They will be hard but do it on your own because it is far better getting bad marks on assignments than bombing the exams which are worth almost 80% of your final grade. </li><li>Make sure you fully understand all the written examples in the textbook. They are pretty similar to the questions you will see in your exams.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="PHYS-159"><a href="#PHYS-159" class="headerlink" title="PHYS 159"></a>PHYS 159</h3><p><em>Difficulty: ‚≠ê</em> </p><p>One credit physics lab which teaches you the various experiment methods. Very high class average with low workload given that most of the work is done in class time. To excel in this course you need to understand what the TAs marking want from you, which is a clear lab report that includes all the criteria.  Getting a good lab partner also helps a lot. </p><ul><li><p>Workload:</p><ul><li>Weekly lab quiz</li><li>In-class lab write-ups</li></ul></li><li><p>Exams:</p><ul><li>No exam just one final lab writeup worth 20% of your grades</li></ul></li><li><p>Study Recommendation:</p><ul><li>Finish your experiment fast and write fast. Include as much detail as possible and conduct more trials if there‚Äôs time for more accuracy. The TAs don‚Äôt really mark you based on your answer but on your process getting to your answer.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="PHYS-170"><a href="#PHYS-170" class="headerlink" title="PHYS 170"></a>PHYS 170</h3><p><em>Difficulty: ‚≠ê‚≠ê</em> </p><p>PHYS 170 teaches you how to draw free-body diagrams and calculate the different forces within them. It is not too hard because the questions on the exam are very similar to past exams.

    <title>Arknights Pull Analysis</title>
    <link href="/2023/06/15/2-Arknights/"/>
    <url>/2023/06/15/2-Arknights/</url>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>This post aims to employ mathematical modeling to estimate the expected number of pulls required to obtain a single <strong>random</strong> 6-star character in the mobile game Arknights. Feel free to utilize the provided catalog on the right-hand side to navigate to the specific sections that pique your interest.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-is-Arknights"><a href="#What-is-Arknights" class="headerlink" title="What is Arknights"></a>What is Arknights</h2><p>Arknights<sup id="fnref:1" class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"><span class="hint--top hint--rounded" aria-label="Arknights (n.d.). Retrieved 20 May 2023, from [https://www.arknights.global](https://www.arknights.global)">[1]</span></a></sup> is a popular mobile tower defense game where players take on the role of a ‚ÄúDoctor‚Äù leading a team of unique operators to defend against threats in a dystopian world.</p><p>The game incorporates a gacha system that revolves around acquiring new operators through randomized draws, each with designated probabilities. Operators are categorized by their star ratings, with 6-star operators considered the most powerful and 1-star operators the least. The probability of obtaining a 6-star operator stands at 2% per roll by default, although exceptions may apply as detailed below:</p><p><strong>In-game description of the pity system:</strong></p><blockquote><p>If you do not roll a 6-star operator after 50 rolls, the probability of obtaining a 6-star Operator on the next roll will be increased from <strong>2%</strong> to <strong>4%</strong>. If you still do not roll a 6-star Operator, the probability of obtaining a 6-star Operator on the next row will be further increased from <strong>4%</strong> to <strong>6%</strong>, and this process repeats until a maximum probability of <strong>100%</strong>, at which point you are guaranteed to receive a 6-star Operator.</p></blockquote><h2 id="The-Problem"><a href="#The-Problem" class="headerlink" title="The Problem"></a>The Problem</h2><p>We know the probability of obtaining a six-star unit in Arknights upon each individual roll, but <strong>we do not know the expected number of rolls required to obtain a six-star unit</strong>.</p><p>Knowing the expected value of obtaining a six-star is important because players need to determine the amount of Orundum (Arknights‚Äô Gacha currency) they need to accumulate prior to event banners in order to safely secure their desired operators. This question is increasingly relevant, particularly with the recent launch of the Limited Event ‚ÄúIL Siracusano‚Äù.</p><p>Numerous attempts have been made to tackle this problem, such as utilizing the <a href="https://rpubs.com/zyLiu6707/arknights-pull-simulation">Monte Carlo Approach</a> or running <a href="https://rpubs.com/Frizu/arknightsgacha">Exploratory Data Analysis</a>. In this post, I will attempt to construct a mathematical model via binomial distribution, offering another perspective on this intriguing problem.</p><p><img src="/img/in-post/IlSiracusano_0.png" alt="IL Siracusano Event Banner"></p><h2 id="Modeling-the-1st-to-50th-Roll"><a href="#Modeling-the-1st-to-50th-Roll" class="headerlink" title="Modeling the 1st to 50th Roll"></a>Modeling the 1st to 50th Roll</h2><p>To establish our model, it‚Äôs important to consider that we are guaranteed to obtain a six-star unit by the 99th roll as our success rate will have increased to 100% by that point. Therefore, our focus lies within the range of the 1st to 99th rolls, as our objective is to secure a single 6-star Operator.</p><p>To apply the binomial distribution, we must ensure that four conditions are met:</p><ol><li>A fixed number of rolls</li><li>Independence between each roll</li><li>Two possible outcomes (success or failure) for each roll</li><li>A constant probability of success throughout</li></ol><p>The binomial distribution equation is expressed as:</p><p>$$<br>P_{x}&#x3D;\left(\begin{array}{l}n \ x\end{array}\right) p^{x} q^{n-x}<br>$$</p><p>where $P$ represents the binomial probability. In our case, we are interested in determining the average number of rolls required to obtain a single six-star unit, so $x$ is set to 1. The probability of success on a single roll $p$ is 2%, while the probability of failure $q$ is 98%. The number of trials $n$ is confined to the range of 1 to 50, as we are focusing on the 1st to 50th rolls exclusively. By defining all these variables, we have completed the formulation of our binomial distribution equation:</p><p>$$<br>P_{1 \text { six star }}&#x3D;\mathrm{n} \times 0.02 \times 0.98^{n-1}, \quad 1 \leq n \leq 50<br>$$</p><p>However, $P$ in the binomial distribution equation represents the probability of obtaining a six-star unit within any of the $n$ trials. This is not aligned with our objective, as we are specifically interested in the probability of obtaining a six-star unit at the $n$ th roll alone, assuming all previous rolls have failed. The order of selection is crucial here because our calculation concludes as soon as we secure a single six-star unit. Consequently, we need to adjust our equation by dividing it by $n$ to account for only one combination being considered:</p><p>$$<br>P_{1 \text { six star on the nth roll only }}&#x3D;\mathrm{n} \div \mathrm{n} \times 0.02 \times 0.98^{n-1}, \quad 1 \leq n \leq 50<br>$$</p><p>By simplifying and expressing the equation as a function, we obtain:</p><p>$$<br>P(n)&#x3D;0.02 \times 0.98^{n-1}, \quad 1 \leq n \leq 50<br>$$</p><h2 id="Modeling-the-51st-to-99th-Roll"><a href="#Modeling-the-51st-to-99th-Roll" class="headerlink" title="Modeling the 51st to 99th Roll"></a>Modeling the 51st to 99th Roll</h2><p>For the 51st to 99th roll, our success rate progressively increases by 2% per roll. This means that the 51st roll has a 4% success rate, the 52nd roll has a 6% success rate, and so on, until reaching the 99th roll with a success rate of 100%.</p><p>Since the success rate is no longer fixed, we need to transition away from using the binomial distribution as our model. Given my limited knowledge and unfamiliarity with any theorems regarding scenarios with changing probabilities, it is evident that we need to devise our own function to effectively model this situation.</p><p>Considering the fixed increase in success rate, it is highly probable that there exists a discernible relationship when evaluating the probability of each individual roll. As the success rate remains fixed on an individual roll basis, we can effectively employ the binomial distribution to calculate the probability of obtaining a six-star unit with each roll.</p><p>Let‚Äôs start with the 51st roll. Referring to our function for the 1st to 50th roll, our $x$ value along with our number of combinations remains constant. Our probability of success $p$ will be set to 4% as mentioned before. However, our probability of failure $q$ will not be set to 96%. If we set $q$ to 96%, we are stating that the probability of failure for all rolls before 51st is 96%, which is not true. Referring to our binomial function for the 1st to 50th roll $P(n)&#x3D;$ $0.02 \times 0.98^{n-1}$, we notice that we only apply our failure probability for $n-1$ rolls. Applying the same concept for the 51st term, we are only concerned with the probability of failure for the 1st to 50th term. Since the probability of failure is constant for the 1st to 50th term, our probability of failure component of the 51st roll is $0.98^{50}$. After defining all our variables, our equation of the 51st roll is complete:</p><p align="center">$P(51)=0.04 \times 0.98^{50}$</p><p>Moving on to the 52nd term, the probability of success increases to 6%. As for the probability of failure, we apply the same principle of calculating it only for the $n-1$ rolls. Consequently, we arrive at a value of $0.96 \times 0.98^{50}$. The 0.96 represents the probability of failure for the 51st roll, while $0.98^{50}$ refers to the probability of failure for the 1st to 50th rolls. With all variables defined, the equation for the 52nd roll is now complete:</p><p align="center">$P(52)=0.06 \times 0.96 \times 0.98^{50}$</p><p>Following the same procedure: </p><p align="center">$P(53)=0.08 \times 0.94 \times 0.96 \times 0.98^{50}$ <br>  $P(54)=0.10 \times 0.92 \times 0.94 \times 0.96 \times 0.98^{50}$ <br>$P(55)=0.12 \times 0.90 \times 0.92 \times 0.94 \times 0.96 \times 0.98^{50}$ <br> ¬∑¬∑¬∑ <br>$P(98)=0.98 \times 0.04 \times 0.06 \times \ldots \times 0.94 \times 0.96 \times 0.98^{50}$ <br>$P(99)=1 \times 0.02 \times 0.04 \times 0.06 \times \ldots \times 0.94 \times 0.96 \times 0.98^{50}$ <br></p><p>From the derived equations, we can extract the probability of success component as follows:</p><p align="center">$(0.02+0.02(n-50)), \quad 51 \leq n \leq 99$</p><p>Simplifying to: </p><p align="center">$0.02(n-49), \quad 51 \leq n \leq 99$</p><p>The probability of failure component can be expressed as a product of an arithmetic series, where the probability of failure decreases by 0.02 for each subsequent roll. Following the formula for the product of an arithmetic series:</p><p align="center">$\prod_{k=0}^{n-1}\left(c_{1}-k d\right)$</p><p>Here, $n$ represents the number of rolls, $c_{1}$ is the first term, and $d$ is the common difference. In our case, $k$ will be 51 since our function starts from the 51st roll, $c_{1}$ will be 0.98, and $d$ will be -0.02. Therefore, the probability of failure component in our function is derived as:</p><p>$$<br>\prod_{k&#x3D;51}^{n-1}(0.98-0.02(k-50)), \quad 50&lt;n \leq 99<br>$$</p><p>The notation $k ‚àí 50$ indicates that we are treating the 51st roll as the first roll in our equation for the 51st to 99th rolls. This notation can be simplified as follows:</p><p>$$<br>\prod_{k&#x3D;51}^{n-1}(1.98-0.02 k), \quad 50&lt;n \leq 99<br>$$</p><p>Combining each component, we can arrive at the final form of our function for the 51st to 99th rolls:</p><p>$$<br>P(n)&#x3D;0.02(n-49) \times 0.98^{50} \times \prod_{k&#x3D;51}^{n-1}(1.98-0.02 k), \quad 50&lt;n \leq 99<br>$$</p><p>It is important to note that the power notation is structured in a way that for the 51st roll, the initial roll is 51, and the number of rolls is 50. This arrangement results in a value of 1, which is intentionally set up as our probability of failure component for the 51st roll is only $0.98^{50}$.</p><p>With this clarification, our mathematical model is now complete:</p><p>$$<br>P(n) &#x3D;<br>\begin{cases}<br>    0.02 \times 0.98^{n-1}, &amp; 1 \leq n \leq 50 \\<br>    0.02 \times (n-49) \times 0.98^{50} \times \prod_{k&#x3D;51}^{n-1}(1.98-0.02k), &amp; 50 &lt; n \leq 99<br>\end{cases}<br>$$</p><h2 id="Graphing-the-Model"><a href="#Graphing-the-Model" class="headerlink" title="Graphing the Model"></a>Graphing the Model</h2><p>We can create a graph to provide a visual representation of the Arknights character pulling model:</p><p><img src="/img/in-post/Ark-Model.png" alt="The Arknights Character Pulling Model"></p><p>This graph demonstrates the probability of obtaining a six-star unit on the $n^{th}$ roll. Examining the graph, we observe that the initial probability of obtaining a six-star is 2%, which serves as our base probability. As subsequent rolls are considered, the probability gradually decreases. This decline is expected, as it indicates that all previous rolls leading up to the successful pull were unsuccessful. The downward trend persists until the 50th roll, where the probability reaches 0.74%.</p><p>At the 51st roll, the pity system activates, resulting in an upward slope. This upward slope indicates that the pity system is functioning as intended, offering higher probabilities for obtaining a six-star unit. The peak probability of 3.35% occurs at the 56th roll. Following this peak, the probability gradually declines, reflecting the impact of the pity system and previous successful rolls.</p><p>Notably, reaching the 99th roll without obtaining a six-star unit is highly unlikely, with a probability close to 0. Conclusively, most players will achieve success before reaching the later stages of the character pulling system. However, it‚Äôs worth noting that the 56th roll, despite having the highest probability, <strong>does not</strong> represent the average roll number we are seeking.</p><h2 id="Solution-1-Cumulative-Probability"><a href="#Solution-1-Cumulative-Probability" class="headerlink" title="Solution 1: Cumulative Probability"></a>Solution 1: Cumulative Probability</h2><p>One approach to determining the average number of rolls required to obtain one six-star unit is to calculate the cumulative probability based on the aforementioned model. The cumulative probability at 50% can serve as an indicator of the average roll, as it signifies that half of the player base has already achieved success in obtaining one six-star unit.</p><p>Using sigma notation to compute the cumulative probability, we obtain:</p><p align="center">$\text { Cumulative Probability }=\sum_{i=1}^{n} P(i), \quad 1 \leq n \leq 99$</p><p>Graphically representing this equation provides further clarity:<br><img src="/img/in-post/Ark-Cumu-Model.png" alt="The Arknights Cumulative Probability Model"></p><p>Upon analyzing the graph, it becomes evident that the cumulative probability reaches 100% at the 99th roll, affirming the accuracy of our equation and model. This validates that the individual probabilities for each roll were calculated correctly, resulting in a cumulative sum of 100%.</p><p>Additionally, the slope of the graph increases notably after the 50th roll, indicating a higher rate of players successfully obtaining a six-star unit due to the implementation of the pity system.</p><p>At the <strong>35th roll</strong>, the cumulative probability stands at 50.69%. This figure represents the average number of rolls required with 50% denoting the point at which half of the player base is expected to have achieved success in obtaining a six-star unit.</p><h2 id="Solution-2-Expected-Values"><a href="#Solution-2-Expected-Values" class="headerlink" title="Solution 2: Expected Values"></a>Solution 2: Expected Values</h2><p>Another approach to determine the average roll is by calculating the expected values, which represent the mean of a probability distribution. For our case of pulling one six-star unit, we can apply the expected value formula. Considering a random variable $X$ with possible rolls $e_{1}, e_{2}, e_{3}, \ldots, e_{n}$ and associated probabilities $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \ldots, a_{n}$, the expected value of $X$ is given by:</p><p align="center">$E(X)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(e_{i} \times a_{i}\right)$</p><p>To calculate the expected value of pulling one six-star unit, we set $e_{i}$ as $i$, since the number of rolls corresponds to the number of trials. The $a_{i}$ values are set as $P(n)$, representing the probability of obtaining one six-star unit for each individual trial. The total number of trials $n$ is set to 99. Therefore, the equation becomes:</p><p align="center">$E(\text { Pulling } 1 \text { Six Star })=\sum_{i=1}^{99}(i \times P(i))$</p><p>Solving this equation yields the result:</p><p align="center">$E(\text { Pulling } 1 \text { Six Star })=34.59$</p><p>Hence, the average number of rolls required to obtain one six-star unit is approximately <strong>34.59 pulls</strong>. This outcome aligns with our cumulative graph, falling between the 34th roll at 49.69% and the 35th roll at 50.69%.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Both solutions lead to a similar conclusion (<strong>34.59%</strong>), which aligns with the cumulative probability graph reaching 100%, as well as other methods like the previously mentioned <a href="https://rpubs.com/zyLiu6707/arknights-pull-simulation">Monte Carlo approach</a> and <a href="https://rpubs.com/Frizu/arknightsgacha">code simulations</a>.</p><p>Taking 35 as the average roll, since rolls are whole numbers, and considering each roll has a cost of 600 Orundum, the average cost of obtaining a six-star unit is 600 √ó 35 &#x3D; <strong>21,000 Orundum</strong>.</p><p>Additionally, I have created an <strong>Arknights Pull Quantile</strong> table:<br><img src="/img/in-post/Ark-Quantile.png" alt="The Arknights Pull Quantile" width="70%"><br>Using this table, I can determine my ‚Äúluckiness‚Äù based on the number of rolls. For example, in the IL Siracusano Event Banner, where I obtained a six-star unit (Texalter) in 26 rolls, I am ranked in the top 40.86% within the player base. This means that I am luckier than approximately 60% of the gamer population :)</p><h2 id="Evaluations-and-Extensions"><a href="#Evaluations-and-Extensions" class="headerlink" title="Evaluations and Extensions"></a>Evaluations and Extensions</h2><p>The process of finding relationships between individual rolls and solving the complex probability problem unfolded as expected. The presented models accurately illustrate the binomial outcome and cumulative probability in obtaining a six-star unit.</p><p>However, I made several mistakes regarding the probability of failure component during the process. It was only when I graphed the cumulative probability that I realized something was amiss. Through multiple iterations and edits, I eventually reached a cumulative probability of 100%. Each adjustment allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the binomial distribution and the contributions of each component in arriving at the solution.</p><p>This investigation can be extended in various directions. Firstly, exploring additional methods to calculate average roll amounts would be valuable. For example, incorporating the Markov property, which accounts for the dependence of a certain roll‚Äôs probability on the outcomes of previous rolls, could offer an intriguing alternative for determining the average roll.</p><p>Another potential extension involves calculating the binomial probability of obtaining a specific six-star unit instead of any six star. This requires accounting for the unique rate of each six-star unit. Consequently, the mathematical model would be adjusted to factor in the varying probabilities associated with each operator.</p><p>Additionally, examining the economic aspect of Arknights and the distribution of the in-game currency Orundum among players could provide valuable insights into player behavior and spending patterns.</p><p>Overall, this post contributes to the growing knowledge base about Arknights, offering a mathematical approach to address the complex issue of obtaining six-star units. Utilizing mathematical modeling techniques, the solutions presented provide players with a better understanding of the game‚Äôs mechanics and the resources required to secure their desired operators. </p><p>If you have any questions or would like to explore this topic further, please do not hesitate to reach out. I would be delighted to delve into further analyses or explore new directions related to Arknights and probability modeling.</p><h2 id="Bibliography"><a href="#Bibliography" class="headerlink" title="Bibliography"></a>Bibliography</h2><section class="footnotes"><div class="footnote-list"><ol><li><span id="fn:1" class="footnote-text"><span>Arknights (n.d.).
