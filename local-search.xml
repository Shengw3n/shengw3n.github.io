    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>In the first year of engineering at UBC, all students take the same set of courses from the standard timetable (STT). In this article, I will provide a comprehensive overview of each course, including its contents, difficulties, and potential challenges.</p></blockquote><p>Typically, your semester will follow a structure similar to the one outlined below, although some Standard Timetable (STT) variations may interchange PHYS 170 and APSC 160. It is recommended to aim to take APSC 160 in the first semester and PHYS 170 in the second semester as indicated here. This is because Math 152, which is only offered in semester 2, helps you learn PHYS 170 contents better; and the coding skills learned in APSC 160 are useful in designing your claw for APSC 101 in term 2. </p><p><strong>Note:</strong>  Most people take an English course (typically WRDS 150) and an arts elective during the first year. They are not included here because I had credits so I just skipped them. </p><p><strong>Another Note:</strong> This is my experience taking first-year courses in the 2022-2023 year. Please note that curriculum changes can occur over time, and the specific courses you will take may vary based on the academic year you are in. For example, in our year, there were significant modifications in Math 100 and Math 101 compared to previous years. Therefore, it is essential to have a look at the most up-to-date curriculum and course offerings for accurate information about your specific academic year.</p><h2 id="General-Advice"><a href="#General-Advice" class="headerlink" title="General Advice"></a>General Advice</h2><p>I took IB Math HL and IB Physics HL so I learned a lot of content prior. The biggest jump for me is the amount of homework for every class. Sometimes it for real feels like there’s no time to study because we are just doing homework all day. Try not to skip every class like me and build a strong foundation throughout the year rather than cramming before exams.  The content is not hard in my opinion, there’s just a lot of content to cover in a relatively short amount of time.  Use <a href="https://ubcgrades.com/">UBCGrades</a> to check the averages for your classes to get a good understanding of the difficulty levels.</p><p>In addition, good exam-taking skills are also vital. You need to be both fast and accurate, especially during midterms when exam times are very short. In my experience, UBC doesn’t give that many part marks for incorrect answers. </p><h2 id="Semester-1"><a href="#Semester-1" class="headerlink" title="Semester 1"></a>Semester 1</h2><h3 id="Math-100"><a href="#Math-100" class="headerlink" title="Math 100"></a>Math 100</h3><p><em>Difficulty: ⭐</em> </p><p>Math 100 teaches you how to do derivatives along with a little bit of optimization and multivariable calculus. If you did IB or AP like me this is essentially a review. Contents are much easier too. The multivariable calculus part was super hard and teaches you about saddle points, Newton’s law of cooling, and crazy year 2 math, but none of it showed up on any exams. </p><ul><li>Resources:<ul><li><a href="https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~CLP/CLP1/">Textbook</a></li><li><a href="https://secure.math.ubc.ca/Ugrad/pastExams/">Past Exams</a></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><p>Workload:</p><ul><li>Weekly math questions</li><li>2 practice exams for participation marks</li><li>5 written group assignments</li></ul></li><li><p>Exams:</p><ul><li>Only 1 final worth 50%, consisting of 10 easy questions and 3-4 hard questions.

They are meme courses that teach you the roles and responsibilities of an engineer and what an engineering design process might look like. You also gain hands-on experience designing cardboard chairs, autonomous claws, etc. It is a meme course because the exams are multiple choices only and all of the choices make sense. So at the end of the day, it’s essentially a test on reading comprehension. You’ll know what I’m talking about when you actually experience it yourself.</p><ul><li><p>Workload:</p><ul><li>Weekly screencast and online quizzes</li><li>Monthly engineering projects (Cardboard chair competition, bike lane design presentations, etc.)<ul><li>Some engineering projects, notably the Rainwater Treatment System in APSC 101, take a really long time to complete. It all depends on how helpful your teammates are.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Exams:</p><ul><li>1 midterm and 1 final,  all multiple-choice. I have gotten better marks not studying than studying. Just make sure your reading comprehension is on point. They scale the exams really hard.</li></ul></li><li><p>Study Recommendations:</p><ul><li>Watch the weekly modules carefully and do a couple of practice exams prior to exams. A good night’s sleep and not overthinking is sometimes more important.  A lot of it is honestly common sense. </li><li>Taking initiative in team management and keeping your group organized is very important because the deadline for projects is often alongside midterms for your other classes and stress can quickly build up.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="CHEM-154"><a href="#CHEM-154" class="headerlink" title="CHEM 154"></a>CHEM 154</h3><p><em>Difficulty: ⭐⭐⭐</em> </p><p>CHEM 154 is essentially Chemistry 12 on steroids. You learn some stoichiometry in the beginning and slowly transition to equilibriums, thermodynamics, kinetics, and electrochemistry.  I am not very good at chemistry nor am I interested so the course felt very hard&#x2F;tedious for me. Each unit by itself isn’t hard at all but there are just too many units.</p><ul><li><p>Workload:</p><ul><li>Weekly workbook questions</li><li>monthly lab writeup</li></ul></li><li><p>Exams:</p><ul><li>1 midterm and 1 final, some short answer questions and some long answers.</li></ul></li><li><p>Study Recommendations:</p><ul><li>Begin your studies early, complete all workbook questions, and ensure a thorough understanding of the material after reviewing the answers.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="PHYS-157"><a href="#PHYS-157" class="headerlink" title="PHYS 157"></a>PHYS 157</h3><p><em>Difficulty: ⭐⭐</em> </p><p>Physics 157 teaches you about thermodynamics and waves and will be your first university-level physics. You will learn that a heat engine is the exact opposite of a refrigerator and how waves can be used to measure space compressions. Honestly, the hardness deserves a ⭐⭐⭐ but this insane <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLODFGtnlvFGdAWq9H3Y6UjyKqCwn6FzoG">YouTube playlist</a> exists. Professor Raamsdonk is the goat.</p><ul><li><p>Workload:</p><ul><li>Weekly reading quiz</li><li>Weekly online Mastering Physics questions or written worksheets</li></ul></li><li><p>Exams:</p><ul><li>2 midterms and 1 final consisting of some multiple-choice and some written questions. Multiple choices are worth a lot of marks and if you mess up just one you lose like 6% on the midterm. The final was pretty light though and perhaps that’s why our average this year was the highest compared to past years.</li></ul></li><li><p>Study Recommendations:</p><ul><li>Watch Professor Raamsdonk ’s YouTube and fully understand it</li><li>Make sure you do all the Mastering Physics questions by yourself, it’s only worth a few percentages it’s much more beneficial to mess up now than during the exams.</li><li>Grind practice and past midterms</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="APSC-160"><a href="#APSC-160" class="headerlink" title="APSC 160"></a>APSC 160</h3><p><em>Difficulty: ⭐</em> </p><p>Definitely the most enjoyable course in the first term. APSC 160 teaches you how to code in C and is the only flipped classroom in the first year (you learn the material at home and the professor goes over the main points in class).  You do not need prior coding experiences to exceed in this course and watching your code run for the first time can be very exciting. Most of the class time is used for homework which means you have minimal workload at home and you can leave class fairly early once you finish.</p><ul><li><p>Workload:</p><ul><li>Weekly screencast and coding assignments</li></ul></li><li><p>Exams:</p><ul><li>2 midterms and 1 final. The first midterm was easy, the second midterm was hard, and the final was easy. Just make sure you can write code fast because the exam is a bit tight on time.</li></ul></li><li><p>Study Recommendations:</p><ul><li>Watch the screencast and do the code assignments on time and by yourself.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="Semester-2"><a href="#Semester-2" class="headerlink" title="Semester 2"></a>Semester 2</h2><h3 id="Math-101"><a href="#Math-101" class="headerlink" title="Math 101"></a>Math 101</h3><p><em>Difficulty: ⭐⭐⭐</em> </p><p>Math 101 teaches you how to do integration for the first half of the course and series for the second half. The integration part was a review from IB but definitely not the series part. </p><ul><li>Resources:<ul><li><a href="https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~CLP/CLP2/">Textbook</a></li><li><a href="https://secure.math.ubc.ca/Ugrad/pastExams/">Past Exams</a></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><p>Workload:</p><ul><li>Weekly math questions</li><li>2 practice exams for participation marks</li><li>5 written group assignments</li></ul></li><li><p>Exams:</p><ul><li>No midterms and 1 final worth 50%, consisting of 10 easy questions and 3-4 hard questions. The past exams were not very useful given the large amount of curriculum change this year.</li></ul></li></ul><p> Study Recommendations:<br>    - Same as MATH 100<br>     - Math 101 has less overlap with high school material compared to Math 100, so it’s beneficial to practice with CLP 2 questions for additional preparation.</p><h3 id="Math-152"><a href="#Math-152" class="headerlink" title="Math 152"></a>Math 152</h3><p><em>Difficulty: ⭐⭐⭐⭐</em> </p><p>Math 152 teaches you linear systems, which is very important in understanding PHYS 170 and ultimately mechanics. The first half consisted of vectors and matrices and was much easier than IB Math HL. The second half consists of eigenvalues and matrix algebra which are all difficult conceptually.  You also learn Matlab basics throughout the course. If you have not studied vectors and planes before I suggest you start learning a bit prior to the start of the course, especially if you are not good at imagining 3D planes. A lot of my friends had trouble understanding at first.</p><ul><li><p>Resources:</p><ul><li><a href="https://secure.math.ubc.ca/Ugrad/pastExams/">Past Exams</a></li></ul></li><li><p>Workload:</p><ul><li>Weekly math questions</li><li>Bi-weekly MATLAB labs</li></ul></li><li><p>Exams:</p><ul><li>2 midterm and 1 final. The midterms were ok but the final was super super super hard.</li></ul></li><li><p>Study Recommendations:</p><ul><li>Same as MATH 100</li><li>Review your exam markings. There are many different methods of solving linear systems and your TA marking may not be aware of your methods.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="PHYS-158"><a href="#PHYS-158" class="headerlink" title="PHYS 158"></a>PHYS 158</h3><p><em>Difficulty: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</em> </p><p>The hardest course in the first year.  PHYS 158 teaches you circuits and magnetism. There are <strong>a lot</strong> of contents and none of them are easy, so definitely start studying early.  Even if you did horrible on your first 2 midterms, don’t give up because if you did well in the final the professor replaces your final course grade with your final exam grade. (<strong>Note</strong>: this is true for my year I’m not sure about yours)</p><ul><li><p>Resources:</p><ul><li>Watch this goated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MichelvanBiezen/featured">Youtube Channel</a> on any topic you don’t understand</li></ul></li><li><p>Workload:</p><ul><li>Weekly reading quiz</li><li>Weekly Mastering Physics or Written Homework</li></ul></li><li><p>Exams: </p><ul><li>2 midterms and 1 final they are all very brutal</li></ul></li><li><p>Study Recommendation:</p><ul><li>Learn material early and fully understand mastering physics and written homework problems. They will be hard but do it on your own because it is far better getting bad marks on assignments than bombing the exams which are worth almost 80% of your final grade. </li><li>Make sure you fully understand all the written examples in the textbook. They are pretty similar to the questions you will see in your exams.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="PHYS-159"><a href="#PHYS-159" class="headerlink" title="PHYS 159"></a>PHYS 159</h3><p><em>Difficulty: ⭐</em> </p><p>One credit physics lab which teaches you the various experiment methods. Very high class average with low workload given that most of the work is done in class time. To excel in this course you need to understand what the TAs marking want from you, which is a clear lab report that includes all the criteria.  Getting a good lab partner also helps a lot. </p><ul><li><p>Workload:</p><ul><li>Weekly lab quiz</li><li>In-class lab write-ups</li></ul></li><li><p>Exams:</p><ul><li>No exam just one final lab writeup worth 20% of your grades</li></ul></li><li><p>Study Recommendation:</p><ul><li>Finish your experiment fast and write fast. Include as much detail as possible and conduct more trials if there’s time for more accuracy. The TAs don’t really mark you based on your answer but on your process getting to your answer.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="PHYS-170"><a href="#PHYS-170" class="headerlink" title="PHYS 170"></a>PHYS 170</h3><p><em>Difficulty: ⭐⭐</em> </p><p>PHYS 170 teaches you how to draw free-body diagrams and calculate the different forces within them. It is not too hard because the questions on the exam are very similar to past exams. There are only a few types of problems and once you grind some you basically see it all.</p><ul><li><p>Workload:</p><ul><li>Weekly mastering physics </li><li>Weekly tutorial</li></ul></li><li><p>Exams:</p><ul><li>One midterm and one final worth 90% of your grades</li></ul></li><li><p>Study Recommendation:</p><ul><li>Learn to draw nice free-body diagrams and start studying early.</li></ul></li></ul><hr><p> And that’s it!

Operators are categorized by their star ratings, with 6-star operators considered the most powerful and 1-star operators the least. The probability of obtaining a 6-star operator stands at 2% per roll by default, although exceptions may apply as detailed below:</p><p><strong>In-game description of the pity system:</strong></p><blockquote><p>If you do not roll a 6-star operator after 50 rolls, the probability of obtaining a 6-star Operator on the next roll will be increased from <strong>2%</strong> to <strong>4%</strong>. If you still do not roll a 6-star Operator, the probability of obtaining a 6-star Operator on the next row will be further increased from <strong>4%</strong> to <strong>6%</strong>, and this process repeats until a maximum probability of <strong>100%</strong>, at which point you are guaranteed to receive a 6-star Operator.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-is-the-problem"><a href="#What-is-the-problem" class="headerlink" title="What is the problem?"></a>What is the problem?</h2><p>We know the probability of obtaining a six-star unit in Arknights upon each individual roll, but <strong>we do not know the expected number of rolls required to obtain a six-star unit</strong>.</p><p>Knowing the expected value of obtaining a six-star is important because players need to determine the amount of Orundum (Arknights’ Gacha currency) they need to accumulate prior to event banners in order to safely secure their desired operators. This question is increasingly relevant, particularly with the recent launch of the Limited Event “IL Siracusano”.</p><p>Numerous attempts have been made to tackle this problem, such as utilizing the <a href="https://rpubs.com/zyLiu6707/arknights-pull-simulation">Monte Carlo Approach</a> or running <a href="https://rpubs.com/Frizu/arknightsgacha">Exploratory Data Analysis</a>. In this post, I will attempt to construct a mathematical model via binomial distribution, offering another perspective on this intriguing problem.</p><p><img src="https://gamepress.gg/arknights/sites/arknights/files/2023-05/IlSiracusanoBanner_0.png" alt="IL Siracusano Event Banner"></p><h2 id="Modeling-the-1st-to-50th-Roll"><a href="#Modeling-the-1st-to-50th-Roll" class="headerlink" title="Modeling the 1st to 50th Roll"></a>Modeling the 1st to 50th Roll</h2><p>To establish our model, it’s important to consider that we are guaranteed to obtain a six-star unit by the 99th roll as our success rate will have increased to 100% by that point. Therefore, our focus lies within the range of the 1st to 99th rolls, as our objective is to secure a single 6-star Operator.</p><p>To apply the binomial distribution, we must ensure that four conditions are met:</p><ol><li>A fixed number of rolls</li><li>Independence between each roll</li><li>Two possible outcomes (success or failure) for each roll</li><li>A constant probability of success throughout</li></ol><p>The binomial distribution equation is expressed as:</p><p>$$<br>P_{x}&#x3D;\left(\begin{array}{l}n \ x\end{array}\right) p^{x} q^{n-x}<br>$$</p><p>where $P$ represents the binomial probability. In our case, we are interested in determining the average number of rolls required to obtain a single six-star unit, so $x$ is set to 1. The probability of success on a single roll $p$ is 2%, while the probability of failure $q$ is 98%. The number of trials $n$ is confined to the range of 1 to 50, as we are focusing on the 1st to 50th rolls exclusively. By defining all these variables, we have completed the formulation of our binomial distribution equation:</p><p>$$<br>P_{1 \text { six star }}&#x3D;\mathrm{n} \times 0.02 \times 0.98^{n-1}, \quad 1 \leq n \leq 50<br>$$</p><p>However, $P$ in the binomial distribution equation represents the probability of obtaining a six-star unit within any of the $n$ trials. This is not aligned with our objective, as we are specifically interested in the probability of obtaining a six-star unit at the $n$ th roll alone, assuming all previous rolls have failed. The order of selection is crucial here because our calculation concludes as soon as we secure a single six-star unit. Consequently, we need to adjust our equation by dividing it by $n$ to account for only one combination being considered:</p><p>$$<br>P_{1 \text { six star on the nth roll only }}&#x3D;\mathrm{n} \div \mathrm{n} \times 0.02 \times 0.98^{n-1}, \quad 1 \leq n \leq 50<br>$$</p><p>By simplifying and expressing the equation as a function, we obtain:</p><p>$$<br>P(n)&#x3D;0.02 \times 0.98^{n-1}, \quad 1 \leq n \leq 50<br>$$</p><h2 id="Modeling-the-51st-to-99th-Roll"><a href="#Modeling-the-51st-to-99th-Roll" class="headerlink" title="Modeling the 51st to 99th Roll"></a>Modeling the 51st to 99th Roll</h2><p>For the 51st to 99th roll, our success rate progressively increases by 2% per roll. This means that the 51st roll has a 4% success rate, the 52nd roll has a 6% success rate, and so on, until reaching the 99th roll with a success rate of 100%.</p><p>Since the success rate is no longer fixed, we need to transition away from using the binomial distribution as our model. Given my limited knowledge and unfamiliarity with any theorems regarding scenarios with changing probabilities, it is evident that we need to devise our own function to effectively model this situation.</p><p>Considering the fixed increase in success rate, it is highly probable that there exists a discernible relationship when evaluating the probability of each individual roll. As the success rate remains fixed on an individual roll basis, we can effectively employ the binomial distribution to calculate the probability of obtaining a six-star unit with each roll.</p><p>Let’s start with the 51st roll. Referring to our function for the 1st to 50th roll, our $x$ value along with our number of combinations remains constant. Our probability of success $p$ will be set to 4% as mentioned before. However, our probability of failure $q$ will not be set to 96%. If we set $q$ to 96%, we are stating that the probability of failure for all rolls before 51st is 96%, which is not true. Referring to our binomial function for the 1st to 50th roll $P(n)&#x3D;$ $0.02 \times 0.98^{n-1}$, we notice that we only apply our failure probability for $n-1$ rolls. Applying the same concept for the 51st term, we are only concerned with the probability of failure for the 1st to 50th term. Since the probability of failure is constant for the 1st to 50th term, our probability of failure component of the 51st roll is $0.98^{50}$. After defining all our variables, our equation of the 51st roll is complete:</p><p align="center">P(51)=0.04 \times 0.98^{50}</p><p>Moving on to the 52nd term, the probability of success increases to 6%. As for the probability of failure, we apply the same principle of calculating it only for the $n-1$ rolls. Consequently, we arrive at a value of 0.96 multiplied by $0.98^{50}$. The 0.96 represents the probability of failure for the 51st roll, while $0.98^{50}$ refers to the probability of failure for the 1st to 50th rolls. With all variables defined, the equation for the 52nd roll is now complete:</p><p align="center">P(52)=0.06 \times 0.96 \times 0.98^{50}</p><p>Following the same procedure: </p><p align="center">$P(53)=0.08 \times 0.94 \times 0.96 \times 0.98^{50}$ <br>  $P(54)=0.10 \times 0.92 \times 0.94 \times 0.96 \times 0.98^{50}$ <br>$P(55)=0.12 \times 0.90 \times 0.92 \times 0.94 \times 0.96 \times 0.98^{50}$ <br> ··· <br>$P(98)=0.98 \times 0.04 \times 0.06 \times \ldots \times 0.94 \times 0.96 \times 0.98^{50}$ <br>$P(99)=1 \times 0.02 \times 0.04 \times 0.06 \times \ldots \times 0.94 \times 0.96 \times 0.98^{50}$ <br></p><p>From the derived equations, we can extract the probability of success component as follows:</p><p align="center">$(0.02+0.02(n-50)), \quad 51 \leq n \leq 99$</p><p>Simplifying to: </p><p align="center">$0.02(n-49), \quad 51 \leq n \leq 99$</p><p>The probability of failure component can be expressed as a product of an arithmetic series, where the probability of failure decreases by 0.02 for each subsequent roll. Following the formula for the product of an arithmetic series:</p><p align="center">$\prod_{k=0}^{n-1}\left(c_{1}-k d\right)$</p><p>Here, $n$ represents the number of rolls, $c1$ is the first term, and $d$ is the common difference. In our case, $k$ will be 51 since our function starts from the 51st roll, $c_{1}$ will be 0.98, and $d$ will be -0.02. Therefore, the probability of failure component in our function is derived as:</p><p>$$<br>\prod_{k&#x3D;51}^{n-1}(0.98-0.02(k-50)), \quad 50&lt;n \leq 99<br>$$</p><p>The notation $k − 50$ indicates that we are treating the 51st roll as the first roll in our equation for the 51st to 99th rolls. This notation can be simplified as follows:</p><p>$$<br>\prod_{k&#x3D;51}^{n-1}(1.98-0.02 k), \quad 50&lt;n \leq 99$<br>$$</p><p>Combining each component, we can arrive at the final form of our function for the 51st to 99th rolls:</p><p>$$<br>P(n)&#x3D;0.02(n-49) \times 0.98^{50} \times \prod_{k&#x3D;51}^{n-1}(1.98-0.02 k), \quad 50&lt;n \leq 99<br>$$</p><p>It is important to note that the power notation is structured in a way that for the 51st roll, the initial roll is 51, and the number of rolls is 50. This arrangement results in a value of 1, which is intentionally set up as our probability of failure component for the 51st roll is only $0.98^{50}$.</p><p>With this clarification, our mathematical model is now complete:</p><p>$$<br>P(n) &#x3D;<br>\begin{cases}<br>    0.02 \times 0.98^{n-1}, &amp; 1 \leq n \leq 50 \\<br>    0.02 \times (n-49) \times 0.98^{50} \times \prod_{k&#x3D;51}^{n-1}(1.98-0.02k), &amp; 50 &lt; n \leq 99<br>\end{cases}<br>$$</p><h2 id="Graphing-the-Model"><a href="#Graphing-the-Model" class="headerlink" title="Graphing the Model"></a>Graphing the Model</h2><p>We can create a graph to provide a visual representation of the Arknights character pulling model:</p><p><img src="/img/in-post/Ark-Model.png" alt="The Arknights Character Pulling Model"></p><p>This graph demonstrates the probability of obtaining a six-star unit on the $n^{th}$ roll. Examining the graph, we observe that the initial probability of obtaining a six-star is 2%, which serves as our base probability. As subsequent rolls are considered, the probability gradually decreases. This decline is expected, as it indicates that all previous rolls leading up to the successful pull were unsuccessful. The downward trend persists until the 50th roll, where the probability reaches 0.74%.</p><p>At the 51st roll, the pity system activates, resulting in an upward slope. This upward slope indicates that the pity system is functioning as intended, offering higher probabilities for obtaining a six-star unit. The peak probability of 3.35% occurs at the 56th roll. Following this peak, the probability gradually declines, reflecting the impact of the pity system and previous successful rolls.</p><p>Notably, reaching the 99th roll without obtaining a six-star unit is highly unlikely, with a probability close to 0. Conclusively, most players will achieve success before reaching the later stages of the character pulling system. However, it’s worth noting that the 56th roll, despite having the highest probability, <strong>does not</strong> represent the average roll number we are seeking.</p><h2 id="Solution-1-Cumulative-Probability"><a href="#Solution-1-Cumulative-Probability" class="headerlink" title="Solution 1: Cumulative Probability"></a>Solution 1: Cumulative Probability</h2><p>One approach to determining the average number of rolls required to obtain one six-star unit is to calculate the cumulative probability based on the aforementioned model. The cumulative probability at 50% can serve as an indicator of the average roll, as it signifies that half of the player base has already achieved success in obtaining one six-star unit.</p><p>Using sigma notation to compute the cumulative probability, we obtain:</p><p align="center">$\text { Cumulative Probability }=\sum_{i=1}^{n} P(i), \quad 1 \leq n \leq 99$</p><p>Graphically representing this equation provides further clarity:<br><img src="/img/in-post/Ark-Cumu-Model.png" alt="The Arknights Cumulative Probability Model"></p><p>Upon analyzing the graph, it becomes evident that the cumulative probability reaches 100% at the 99th roll, affirming the accuracy of our equation and model. This validates that the individual probabilities for each roll were calculated correctly, resulting in a cumulative sum of 100%.</p><p>Additionally, the slope of the graph increases notably after the 50th roll, indicating a higher rate of players successfully obtaining a six-star unit due to the implementation of the pity system.</p><p>At the <strong>35th roll</strong>, the cumulative probability stands at 50.69%. This figure represents the average number of rolls required with 50% denoting the point at which half of the player base is expected to have achieved success in obtaining a six-star unit.</p><h2 id="Solution-2-Expected-Values"><a href="#Solution-2-Expected-Values" class="headerlink" title="Solution 2: Expected Values"></a>Solution 2: Expected Values</h2><p>Another approach to determine the average roll is by calculating the expected values, which represent the mean of a probability distribution. For our case of pulling one six-star unit, we can apply the expected value formula. Considering a random variable $X$ with possible rolls $e_{1}, e_{2}, e_{3}, \ldots, e_{n}$ and associated probabilities $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \ldots, a_{n}$, the expected value of $X$ is given by:</p><p align="center">$E(X)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(e_{i} \times a_{i}\right)$</p><p>To calculate the expected value of pulling one six-star unit, we set $e_{i}$ as $i$, since the number of rolls corresponds to the number of trials. The $a_{i}$ values are set as $P(n)$, representing the probability of obtaining one six-star unit for each individual trial. The total number of trials $n$ is set to 99. Therefore, the equation becomes:</p><p align="center">$E(\text { Pulling } 1 \text { Six Star })=\sum_{i=1}^{99}(i \times P(i))$</p><p>Solving this equation yields the result:</p><p align="center">$E(\text { Pulling } 1 \text { Six Star })=34.59$</p><p>Hence, the average number of rolls required to obtain one six-star unit is approximately <strong>34.59 pulls</strong>. This outcome aligns with our cumulative graph, falling between the 34th roll at 49.69% and the 35th roll at 50.69%.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Both solutions lead to a similar conclusion (<strong>34.59%</strong>), which aligns with the cumulative probability graph reaching 100%, as well as other methods like the previously mentioned <a href="https://rpubs.com/zyLiu6707/arknights-pull-simulation">Monte Carlo approach</a> and <a href="https://rpubs.com/Frizu/arknightsgacha">code simulations</a>.</p><p>Taking 35 as the average roll, since rolls are whole numbers, and considering each roll has a cost of 600 Orundum, the average cost of obtaining a six-star unit is 600 × 35 &#x3D; <strong>21,000 Orundum</strong>.</p><p>Additionally, I have created an <strong>Arknights Pull Quantile</strong> table:</p><p><img src="/img/in-post/Ark-Quantile.png" alt="The Arknights Pull Quantile"></p><p>Using this table, I can determine my “luckiness” based on the number of rolls. For example, in the IL Siracusano Event Banner, where I obtained a six-star unit (Texalter) in 26 rolls, I am ranked in the top 40.86% within the player base. This means that I am luckier than approximately 60% of the gamer population :)</p><h2 id="Evaluations-and-Extensions"><a href="#Evaluations-and-Extensions" class="headerlink" title="Evaluations and Extensions"></a>Evaluations and Extensions</h2><p>The process of finding relationships between individual rolls and solving the complex probability problem unfolded as expected. The presented models accurately illustrate the binomial outcome and cumulative probability in obtaining a six-star unit.</p><p>However, I made several mistakes regarding the probability of failure component during the process. It was only when I graphed the cumulative probability that I realized something was amiss. Through multiple iterations and edits, I eventually reached a cumulative probability of 100%. Each adjustment allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the binomial distribution and the contributions of each component in arriving at the solution.</p><p>This investigation can be extended in various directions. Firstly, exploring additional methods to calculate average roll amounts would be valuable. For example, incorporating the Markov property, which accounts for the dependence of a certain roll’s probability on the outcomes of previous rolls, could offer an intriguing alternative for determining the average roll.</p><p>Another potential extension involves calculating the binomial probability of obtaining a specific six-star unit instead of any six star. This requires accounting for the unique rate of each six-star unit. Consequently, the mathematical model would be adjusted to factor in the varying probabilities associated with each operator.</p><p>Additionally, examining the economic aspect of Arknights and the distribution of the in-game currency Orundum among players could provide valuable insights into player behavior and spending patterns.</p><p>Overall, this post contributes to the growing knowledge base about Arknights, offering a mathematical approach to address the complex issue of obtaining six-star units. Utilizing mathematical modeling techniques, the solutions presented provide players with a better understanding of the game’s mechanics and the resources required to secure their desired operators. </p><p>If you have any questions or would like to explore this topic further, please do not hesitate to reach out. I would be delighted to delve into further analyses or explore new directions related to Arknights and probability modeling.</p><h2 id="Bibliography"><a href="#Bibliography" class="headerlink" title="Bibliography"></a>Bibliography</h2><section class="footnotes"><div class="footnote-list"><ol><li><span id="fn:1" class="footnote-text"><span>Arknights (n.d.).
