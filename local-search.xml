    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>本篇是对 <code>2024-07-08</code> 到 <code>2024-07-14</code> 这周生活的记录与思考。</p></blockquote><h3 id="忙碌的一周"><a href="#忙碌的一周" class="headerlink" title="忙碌的一周"></a>忙碌的一周</h3><p>刚爬完<a href="https://shengw3n.github.io/2024/07/08/Weekly_Report_1/#Garibaldi-Lake">22公里的山</a>就去乘船<a href="https://shengw3n.github.io/2024/07/15/Weekly_Report_2/#%E6%8C%96%E7%94%9F%E8%9A%9D%E4%B9%8BNanaimo%E4%B8%80%E6%97%A5%E6%B8%B8">挖生蚝</a>，身体累。同一周还为了赶上Launch Canada的比赛，在一天内写完了37页的技术报告，心也累。更糟糕的是，还把比赛要用的<a href="https://shengw3n.github.io/2024/07/15/Weekly_Report_2/#UBC-Rockets">电调烧了</a>，心更累了。上一周的周报写得很丧，这周心态还行。果然还是忙碌干活让我感觉充实。大三马上就要开始了，下周要开始学习学业上的东西了。顺便实习也得开始准备起来了。</p><h3 id="UBC-Rockets"><a href="#UBC-Rockets" class="headerlink" title="UBC Rockets"></a>UBC Rockets</h3><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.ubcrocket.com/">UBC Rocket</a> 是一个UBC工程学生设计团队，致力于亚轨道火箭的设计、制造和发射。目前我们有三个火箭项目并行研发：液态火箭、二级固态火箭和自着陆火箭。我正在负责其中的自着陆火箭项目，<a href="https://github.com/UBC-Rocket/Thrust-Vectoring">Thrust Vector Rocket</a>。</p></blockquote><p>这周我干了一件很蠢的事，把火箭的电调烧了。事情的起因是火箭的发动机推力一直没有达到预期的9kg，只在4kg左右徘徊。我和我们组的另一位lead一直在找原因，最后得出结论应该不是代码的问题，而是供电的问题。于是我们开始重新布置供电电路。然而我们两人同时脑子短路，把电路的电压干到了发动机接受范围的两倍，直接烧毁了电调。</p><p>这件事对我来说是一个深刻的教训。当时我们太急躁了，想着这么多天还没解决问题，没有停下来好好思考一下。以后还是得慢慢来，对这种高电压的电路，测试之前还是应该让别人检查一遍以确保稳妥。</p><p><strong>软件进展</strong><br>关于软件方面，这周我把陀螺仪和加速度计的传感信息用卡尔曼滤波处理了一下，然后将得到的角度数据输入到PID控制器中。至此，8月份在Launch Canada比赛中要展示的悬浮功能差不多已经成型了。跟液态火箭组的一个Lead视频咨询了一下，决定不做Matlab模型直接用Ziegler-Nichols 调参方法现场调试PID。做模型太复杂了直接现场调大力出奇迹。</p><p>下周等新的电调来了，机械组把调试台做好，就可以开始调试PID了。顺便也该开始测试无线网功能了。</p><div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 75%;"><iframe src="/vid/IMG_6815.MOV" alt="Gimbal PID Testing" scrolling="no" border="0" frameborder="no" framespacing="0" allowfullscreen="true" style="position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; left: 0; top: 0;"> </iframe></div><h3 id="挖生蚝之Nanaimo一日游"><a href="#挖生蚝之Nanaimo一日游" class="headerlink" title="挖生蚝之Nanaimo一日游"></a>挖生蚝之Nanaimo一日游</h3><p>周二买了张一日捕鱼证，乘渡船去了趟Nanaimo挖生蚝。第一次挖，整个沙滩遍地都是生蚝，赞👍。 顺路去了Todd Creek Trestle，非常平庸的的一个桥梁景点，看了一次不会看第二次</p><div class="group-image-container"><div class="group-image-row"><div class="group-image-wrap"><img src="/img/in-post/DSCF3429.jpeg"></div><div class="group-image-wrap"><img src="/img/in-post/DSCF3204.jpeg"></div><div class="group-image-wrap"><img src="/img/in-post/DSCF3304.jpeg"></div></div><div class="group-image-row"><div class="group-image-wrap"><img src="/img/in-post/DSCF3425.jpeg"></div><div class="group-image-wrap"><img src="/img/in-post/DSCF3115.jpeg"></div></div></div>]]></content>

    <title>周报#1 - 梦想，快乐，与持之以恒</title>
    <link href="/2024/07/08/Weekly_Report_1/"/>
    <url>/2024/07/08/Weekly_Report_1/</url>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>本篇是对 <code>2024-07-01</code> 到 <code>2024-07-07</code> 这周生活的记录与思考。</p></blockquote><p>写周报的念头应该是从一年前刷到<a href="https://www.pseudoyu.com/zh/">pseudoyu</a>的博客后萌生的。我也希望像他一样以每周为单位，观察并衡量自己的生活、工作与学习。自从进入大学后，繁忙的学业、自主安排的时间以及生活中的各种噪音似乎侵占了我独立思考的时间。随着思维的迟钝，我的学习效率和动力也逐渐消失。看到我的绩点一学期比一学期差，离我设想的完美自己渐行渐远时，我意识到自己到了人生一个关键的转折点：是继续纵容自己这样继续堕落下去，还是重新振作改头换新。这也是我写周报的初衷，希望可以鞭策自己向我想成为的自己靠拢。</p><p>尽管说的很冠冕堂皇，但是我写这个周报也已经拖延近半年了。“等考试结束再写”，“等面试完再写”，这正是我的拖延症的完美映射。毕竟我从小就来到加拿大，我的中文水平只有中国小学四年级上学期的程度，而用英文写这么personal的东西属实有点尴尬，所以如果写的不好还请谅解。。。</p><h3 id="梦想、坚持与失败后的痛苦"><a href="#梦想、坚持与失败后的痛苦" class="headerlink" title="梦想、坚持与失败后的痛苦"></a>梦想、坚持与失败后的痛苦</h3><p>我的梦想似乎从我小的时候起就没有变过。十岁时看动漫《反叛的鲁路修》和《高达00》的炫酷巨型机器人，便确定了以后要当一名工程师。甚至在大一面试工程物理专业时，我还向教授解释了我的造高达梦。教授非常“认可”的来了句good luck。太中二了。</p><p>十二岁时开始接触击剑，一年后突然冒出要进入国家队的目标。这是我立下的第一个大目标，我和我妈为此付出了很多时间、金钱和汗水。目标是十年级时冲击U17国家队，为此我几乎每天都在击剑，放学就跑剑馆，各种地方、全国比赛都飞去参加（尽管成绩不理想）。结果十年级报名后，疫情来了。封禁的几年里虽然我依然在训练，但解封时我已经12年级了。面临IB高考和大学申请，时间紧张，击剑进国家队的梦似乎也告一段落。但我仍抱有幻想。直到大一参加了一次加拿大杯，跟现役国家队成员比，我才意识到差距有多大。至此，认真学习工程才是正解。</p><p>但我依然无法与自己和解。在击剑俱乐部里，比我大几届的师兄进过国家队，比我大一届的师兄进过，比我小一届的师弟进过，甚至比我早击剑半年的朋友今年要去巴黎奥运会参赛了。我的击剑，即使没有疫情，我进国家队的概率也不是很高。比起比赛早早出成绩的队友们，大器晚成的安慰是多么的无力。 我必须知道，自己与他们相比，缺少了什么。</p><p>我缺少两样东西， 两样我至今都没有获得的东西：一是渴望胜利的心。这反映在学习上也是如此。我喜欢击剑，喜欢国家队的头衔，但在比赛时，你不会看到我有不惜一切想赢下比赛的决心。我得分后不会叫，输掉比赛不会哭，赢了比赛也不会特别兴奋，与对手相比，胜负似乎与我无关。这无疑与我的梦想矛盾，但这就是现实中的我。就像考试成绩，我喜欢成绩高，但似乎成绩低也不会特别难受。这种梦想与现实表现的巨大反差，是我痛苦的来源。</p><p>第二个缺少的是持之以恒的努力。在大一时，师兄告诉我，我确实是击剑馆最热爱击剑的，也是训练最卖力的，但我只在击剑馆卖力。我的大脑没有时刻想着击剑，回家后也不会练步伐，看击剑视频。而师兄师弟们回家后还在看不见的地方继续练剑，我回家似乎只有做作业和玩游戏。映射在学习上，我的努力似乎也是断断续续，无法做到真正的持之以恒，长时间全身心的投入到一件事上。</p><p>梦想与现实表现的巨大反差使我异常困惑。这两点无疑是我目前最大的缺陷。但我该如何改？我要怎样才能有一颗渴望胜利的心呢？我仍没有找到答案。</p><h3 id="高达梦，-工程梦"><a href="#高达梦，-工程梦" class="headerlink" title="高达梦， 工程梦"></a>高达梦， 工程梦</h3><p>正如前文所述，我十岁时就决定要成为一名工程师。在我的第一个目标——进入击剑国家队——惨遭失败后，我对工程梦想的追求变得更加谨慎。我不是一个害怕失败和选择的人，至少之前没有那么敏感。然而，随着年龄的增长，不安和恐惧变得愈加显著。面试工作被拒、考试成绩不理想、工程项目运行失败……这些挫折让我浮躁，而浮躁让我更难专心下来。当安全感如洋葱般被一层层剥开，孤独感迅速侵袭。正如pseudoyu在他的周报中所说，“也许在之后很久的时光里，孤独感都会像是一个朋友一样如影随形，我尚未学会如何与它相处，但也逐渐在习惯它的存在。” 我也在慢慢适应这种孤独感。</p><h3 id="UBC-Rockets"><a href="#UBC-Rockets" class="headerlink" title="UBC Rockets"></a>UBC Rockets</h3><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.ubcrocket.com/">UBC Rocket</a> 是一个UBC工程学生设计团队，致力于亚轨道火箭的设计、制造和发射。目前我们有三个火箭项目并行研发：液态火箭、二级固态火箭和自着陆火箭。我正在负责其中的自着陆火箭项目，<a href="https://github.com/UBC-Rocket/Thrust-Vectoring">Thrust Vector Rocket</a>。</p></blockquote><p>这周主要把基础PID控制代码给写了. 原理很简单，如果火箭往一边倾斜，火箭gimbal就往另一边倾斜把它纠正回去。具体模型 Matlab 文件夹都还没创建，下周再说吧。</p><figure class="highlight c++"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="hljs C++">inputY = a.acceleration.y;

    <title>How I saved my roommate&#39;s life</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="note note-primary">            <p>Steven Lore Update: In my second year of university, I found myself without UBC housing, so I decided to rent an apartment with a buddy of mine, John, a fellow second-year UBC science student.</p>          </div><p>I can still vividly recall that fateful night. It was a typical dark and rainy evening in Vancouver. John, my roommate, had attempted to use his air fryer to cook pork ribs when, suddenly, the entire kitchen was engulfed in darkness. The abrupt blackout sent his fridge – the sanctuary of his beloved lemon ice creams – into turmoil.</p><p>Now, John, not being an engineering student, immediately spiraled into a full-blown panic. He couldn’t cook, and his food was teetering on the brink of spoiling. He was perilously close to surrendering to the siren call of McDonald’s, the last refuge of the desperate.</p><p>And then, in the midst of this culinary chaos, I emerged as the hero, puzzled by the mysterious commotion in our kitchen. A swift assessment of the situation revealed that this was no ordinary power outage. The lights in the rest of the apartment were humming along just fine.</p><p>As a student of electrical engineering, my intuition told me that we were grappling with a circuit breaker, one of those electrical switches designed to shield circuits from overcurrent or overload disasters.</p><p>I turned to John, who confessed to a kitchen appliance frenzy, using multiple power-hungry gadgets simultaneously. My suspicion was confirmed. With an unwavering determination to rescue my roommate from the clutches of fast food misery, I set out to track down our apartment’s electrical lifeline.</p><p>Lo and behold, right in front of my bed, there it was—the circuit breaker panel. The switch had been flipped, defying our kitchen’s power flow. </p><p>“Click.”</p><p>The kitchen erupted with light, and my roommate was saved from his impending McDonald’s catastrophe. His lemon ice creams were safe, and his food was spared from an untimely demise.</p><p>Being a hero isn’t always easy; it’s demanding work. But on that dark and stormy night in Vancouver, I emerged as the electric savior my roommate never knew he needed.</p>]]></content>

    <title>My First Engineering Internship</title>
    <link href="/2023/09/15/4-First-Internship/"/>
    <url>/2023/09/15/4-First-Internship/</url>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During the summer, I traveled back to China to visit my grandparents, marking my first return in over four years due to COVID-19 restrictions. While in China, I applied for an internship at a  local storage robotics company known as <a href="https://en.ny-zn.com/">Bullseye</a>. Bullseye specializes in designing and manufacturing storage robotics for large corporations such as Starbucks, Siemens, and Jingdong. (You can click on their website for a fascinating animation demonstrating how these robots operate.)</p><p><img src="/img/in-post/bullseye.jpg" alt="A Bullseye Storage Robotics Warehouse"></p><p>Initially, I applied for a position as an embedded engineer, but during the interview, we realized that I wouldn’t have enough time to learn the necessary skills for embedded engineering, given that I needed to return to school in September. Which is fair since I had just completed my first year of studies.</p><p>However, they offered an alternative opportunity: interning as a front-end developer. Without hesitation, I accepted their offer, read through the internship and employee policies, and signed both the internship contract and the non-disclosure agreement. And now, here I am, in my first ever cubicle.<br><img src="/img/in-post/niuyan_desk.JPG" alt="Me at my cubicle"></p><h2 id="What-I-Learned"><a href="#What-I-Learned" class="headerlink" title="What I Learned"></a>What I Learned</h2><p>Working from 8 to 5 as a front-end developer, the role involved utilizing languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vue to create user interfaces. At Bullseye, this meant designing interfaces for controlling storage robotics and providing information about warehouse occupancy, item locations, and more.</p><p>Although front-end development differs significantly from electrical engineering, I found the subject extremely engaging. The ability to present data and information in a visually pleasing manner resonated with me, and the coding skills I acquired during my internship ultimately enabled me to create and maintain this blog.</p><p>Beyond technical skills, I also gained insights into the inner workings of an engineering R&amp;D company. This environment was a stark contrast to my previous job as a fencing coach, where I was constantly surrounded by younger children. At Bullseye, the atmosphere was both serious and engaging. My colleagues were incredibly friendly, and whenever I had questions about my tasks, my manager was always there to support me. Furthermore, the human resources department was equally accommodating, always ready to address any queries I had.</p><p>In addition, due to a shortage of available cubicles in the R&amp;D department, I was assigned to sit with the sales department. Listening to their daily sales calls also provided me with an unusual but valuable experience.</p><h2 id="Monday-Morning-Meetings"><a href="#Monday-Morning-Meetings" class="headerlink" title="Monday Morning Meetings"></a>Monday Morning Meetings</h2><p>Every Monday morning, my colleagues and I would assemble in formation, much like soldiers. We’d begin by reciting the company’s goals, and our director would then go on to list the accomplishments of each department from the previous week and note any follow-up tasks. Afterward, he’d assign new tasks to each department and share major updates, such as new clients, challenges, and achievements. The meeting lasted less than 10 minutes, but it had a profound impact on everyone’s morale. Perhaps it’s a tradition in Chinese companies to infuse enthusiasm and motivation into their work culture.<br><img src="/img/in-post/morning_meeting.jpeg" alt="The Monday Meeting"></p><h2 id="The-Lunch-Breaks"><a href="#The-Lunch-Breaks" class="headerlink" title="The Lunch Breaks"></a>The Lunch Breaks</h2><p>Our lunch break commences at 12 p.m. and extends for an hour. The office was conveniently located near several restaurants, and the best part was that we received lunch subsidies. I must say, I absolutely relished dining in China.<br><img src="/img/in-post/work_lunch.jpeg" alt="Typical Lunch at Work"></p><h2 id="The-Takeaway"><a href="#The-Takeaway" class="headerlink" title="The Takeaway"></a>The Takeaway</h2><p>I’m uncertain whether I’ll ever use front-end coding in my electrical engineering career, but I’m certain that without this internship, I wouldn’t have been able to create this blog. Working at an actual engineering company over the summer was an enjoyable and enlightening experience. I acquired numerous skills that are transferable to various other positions and endeavours. As the UBC Co-op office advises, seize every learning opportunity that comes your way, and your path will unfold before you.</p>]]></content>

    <title>Guide to First-Year Engineering Courses at UBC</title>
    <link href="/2023/07/03/3-UBC-First-Year-EngCourses/"/>
    <url>/2023/07/03/3-UBC-First-Year-EngCourses/</url>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>In the first year of engineering at UBC, all students take the same set of courses from the standard timetable (STT). In this article, I will provide a comprehensive overview of each course, including its contents, difficulties, and potential challenges.</p></blockquote><p>Typically, your semester will follow a structure similar to the one outlined below, although some Standard Timetable (STT) variations may interchange PHYS 170 and APSC 160. It is recommended to aim to take APSC 160 in the first semester and PHYS 170 in the second semester as indicated here. This is because Math 152, which is only offered in semester 2, helps you learn PHYS 170 contents better; and the coding skills learned in APSC 160 are useful in designing your claw for APSC 101 in term 2. </p><p><strong>Note:</strong>  Most people take an English course (typically WRDS 150) and an arts elective during the first year. They are not included here because I had credits so I just skipped them. </p><p><strong>Another Note:</strong> This is my experience taking first-year courses in the 2022-2023 year. Please note that curriculum changes can occur over time, and the specific courses you will take may vary based on the academic year you are in. For example, in our year, there were significant modifications in Math 100 and Math 101 compared to previous years. Therefore, it is essential to have a look at the most up-to-date curriculum and course offerings for accurate information about your specific academic year.</p><h2 id="General-Advice"><a href="#General-Advice" class="headerlink" title="General Advice"></a>General Advice</h2><p>I took IB Math HL and IB Physics HL so I learned a lot of content prior. The biggest jump for me is the amount of homework for every class. Sometimes it for real feels like there’s no time to study because we are just doing homework all day. Try not to skip every class like me and build a strong foundation throughout the year rather than cramming before exams.  The content is not hard in my opinion, there’s just a lot of content to cover in a relatively short amount of time.  Use <a href="https://ubcgrades.com/">UBCGrades</a> to check the averages for your classes to get a good understanding of the difficulty levels.</p><p>In addition, good exam-taking skills are also vital. You need to be both fast and accurate, especially during midterms when exam times are very short. In my experience, UBC doesn’t give that many part marks for incorrect answers. </p><h2 id="Semester-1"><a href="#Semester-1" class="headerlink" title="Semester 1"></a>Semester 1</h2><h3 id="Math-100"><a href="#Math-100" class="headerlink" title="Math 100"></a>Math 100</h3><p><em>Difficulty: ⭐</em> </p><p>Math 100 teaches you how to do derivatives along with a little bit of optimization and multivariable calculus. If you did IB or AP like me this is essentially a review. Contents are much easier too. The multivariable calculus part was super hard and teaches you about saddle points, Newton’s law of cooling, and crazy year 2 math, but none of it showed up on any exams. </p><ul><li>Resources:<ul><li><a href="https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~CLP/CLP1/">Textbook</a></li><li><a href="https://secure.math.ubc.ca/Ugrad/pastExams/">Past Exams</a></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><p>Workload:</p><ul><li>Weekly math questions</li><li>2 practice exams for participation marks</li><li>5 written group assignments</li></ul></li><li><p>Exams:</p><ul><li>Only 1 final worth 50%, consisting of 10 easy questions and 3-4 hard questions. Many questions were pretty similar to assignments and past exams.</li></ul></li><li><p>Study Recommendations:</p><ul><li>Make sure you can do the weekly math questions with ease.</li><li>Grind past&#x2F;practice exams and review group assignments prior to finals.</li><li>Group assignments are worth 20% of your final grade and they mark it very harshly. Make sure someone in your group knows latex.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="APSC-100-101"><a href="#APSC-100-101" class="headerlink" title="APSC 100&#x2F;101"></a>APSC 100&#x2F;101</h3><p><em>Difficulty: ⭐⭐</em> </p><p>APSC 100 in term 1, and APSC 101 in term 2. They are meme courses that teach you the roles and responsibilities of an engineer and what an engineering design process might look like. You also gain hands-on experience designing cardboard chairs, autonomous claws, etc. It is a meme course because the exams are multiple choices only and all of the choices make sense. So at the end of the day, it’s essentially a test on reading comprehension. You’ll know what I’m talking about when you actually experience it yourself.</p><ul><li><p>Workload:</p><ul><li>Weekly screencast and online quizzes</li><li>Monthly engineering projects (Cardboard chair competition, bike lane design presentations, etc.)<ul><li>Some engineering projects, notably the Rainwater Treatment System in APSC 101, take a really long time to complete. It all depends on how helpful your teammates are.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Exams:</p><ul><li>1 midterm and 1 final,  all multiple-choice. I have gotten better marks not studying than studying. Just make sure your reading comprehension is on point. They scale the exams really hard.</li></ul></li><li><p>Study Recommendations:</p><ul><li>Watch the weekly modules carefully and do a couple of practice exams prior to exams. A good night’s sleep and not overthinking is sometimes more important.  A lot of it is honestly common sense. </li><li>Taking initiative in team management and keeping your group organized is very important because the deadline for projects is often alongside midterms for your other classes and stress can quickly build up.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="CHEM-154"><a href="#CHEM-154" class="headerlink" title="CHEM 154"></a>CHEM 154</h3><p><em>Difficulty: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</em> </p><p>CHEM 154 is essentially Chemistry 12 on steroids.

Retrieved 20 May 2023, from [https://www.arknights.global](https://www.arknights.global)">[1]</span></a></sup> is a popular mobile tower defense game where players take on the role of a “Doctor” leading a team of unique operators to defend against threats in a dystopian world.</p><p>The game incorporates a gacha system that revolves around acquiring new operators through randomized draws, each with designated probabilities. Operators are categorized by their star ratings, with 6-star operators considered the most powerful and 1-star operators the least. The probability of obtaining a 6-star operator stands at 2% per roll by default, although exceptions may apply as detailed below:</p><p><strong>In-game description of the pity system:</strong></p><blockquote><p>If you do not roll a 6-star operator after 50 rolls, the probability of obtaining a 6-star Operator on the next roll will be increased from <strong>2%</strong> to <strong>4%</strong>.

This question is increasingly relevant, particularly with the recent launch of the Limited Event “IL Siracusano”.</p><p>Numerous attempts have been made to tackle this problem, such as utilizing the <a href="https://rpubs.com/zyLiu6707/arknights-pull-simulation">Monte Carlo Approach</a> or running <a href="https://rpubs.com/Frizu/arknightsgacha">Exploratory Data Analysis</a>. In this post, I will attempt to construct a mathematical model via binomial distribution, offering another perspective on this intriguing problem.</p><p><img src="/img/in-post/IlSiracusano_0.png" alt="IL Siracusano Event Banner"></p><h2 id="Modeling-the-1st-to-50th-Roll"><a href="#Modeling-the-1st-to-50th-Roll" class="headerlink" title="Modeling the 1st to 50th Roll"></a>Modeling the 1st to 50th Roll</h2><p>To establish our model, it’s important to consider that we are guaranteed to obtain a six-star unit by the 99th roll as our success rate will have increased to 100% by that point. Therefore, our focus lies within the range of the 1st to 99th rolls, as our objective is to secure a single 6-star Operator.</p><p>To apply the binomial distribution, we must ensure that four conditions are met:</p><ol><li>A fixed number of rolls</li><li>Independence between each roll</li><li>Two possible outcomes (success or failure) for each roll</li><li>A constant probability of success throughout</li></ol><p>The binomial distribution equation is expressed as:</p><p>$$<br>P_{x}&#x3D;\left(\begin{array}{l}n \ x\end{array}\right) p^{x} q^{n-x}<br>$$</p><p>where $P$ represents the binomial probability. In our case, we are interested in determining the average number of rolls required to obtain a single six-star unit, so $x$ is set to 1. The probability of success on a single roll $p$ is 2%, while the probability of failure $q$ is 98%. The number of trials $n$ is confined to the range of 1 to 50, as we are focusing on the 1st to 50th rolls exclusively. By defining all these variables, we have completed the formulation of our binomial distribution equation:</p><p>$$<br>P_{1 \text { six star }}&#x3D;\mathrm{n} \times 0.02 \times 0.98^{n-1}, \quad 1 \leq n \leq 50<br>$$</p><p>However, $P$ in the binomial distribution equation represents the probability of obtaining a six-star unit within any of the $n$ trials. This is not aligned with our objective, as we are specifically interested in the probability of obtaining a six-star unit at the $n$ th roll alone, assuming all previous rolls have failed. The order of selection is crucial here because our calculation concludes as soon as we secure a single six-star unit. Consequently, we need to adjust our equation by dividing it by $n$ to account for only one combination being considered:</p><p>$$<br>P_{1 \text { six star on the nth roll only }}&#x3D;\mathrm{n} \div \mathrm{n} \times 0.02 \times 0.98^{n-1}, \quad 1 \leq n \leq 50<br>$$</p><p>By simplifying and expressing the equation as a function, we obtain:</p><p>$$<br>P(n)&#x3D;0.02 \times 0.98^{n-1}, \quad 1 \leq n \leq 50<br>$$</p><h2 id="Modeling-the-51st-to-99th-Roll"><a href="#Modeling-the-51st-to-99th-Roll" class="headerlink" title="Modeling the 51st to 99th Roll"></a>Modeling the 51st to 99th Roll</h2><p>For the 51st to 99th roll, our success rate progressively increases by 2% per roll. This means that the 51st roll has a 4% success rate, the 52nd roll has a 6% success rate, and so on, until reaching the 99th roll with a success rate of 100%.</p><p>Since the success rate is no longer fixed, we need to transition away from using the binomial distribution as our model. Given my limited knowledge and unfamiliarity with any theorems regarding scenarios with changing probabilities, it is evident that we need to devise our own function to effectively model this situation.</p><p>Considering the fixed increase in success rate, it is highly probable that there exists a discernible relationship when evaluating the probability of each individual roll. As the success rate remains fixed on an individual roll basis, we can effectively employ the binomial distribution to calculate the probability of obtaining a six-star unit with each roll.</p><p>Let’s start with the 51st roll. Referring to our function for the 1st to 50th roll, our $x$ value along with our number of combinations remains constant. Our probability of success $p$ will be set to 4% as mentioned before. However, our probability of failure $q$ will not be set to 96%. If we set $q$ to 96%, we are stating that the probability of failure for all rolls before 51st is 96%, which is not true. Referring to our binomial function for the 1st to 50th roll $P(n)&#x3D;$ $0.02 \times 0.98^{n-1}$, we notice that we only apply our failure probability for $n-1$ rolls. Applying the same concept for the 51st term, we are only concerned with the probability of failure for the 1st to 50th term. Since the probability of failure is constant for the 1st to 50th term, our probability of failure component of the 51st roll is $0.98^{50}$. After defining all our variables, our equation of the 51st roll is complete:</p><p align="center">$P(51)=0.04 \times 0.98^{50}$</p><p>Moving on to the 52nd term, the probability of success increases to 6%. As for the probability of failure, we apply the same principle of calculating it only for the $n-1$ rolls. Consequently, we arrive at a value of $0.96 \times 0.98^{50}$. The 0.96 represents the probability of failure for the 51st roll, while $0.98^{50}$ refers to the probability of failure for the 1st to 50th rolls. With all variables defined, the equation for the 52nd roll is now complete:</p><p align="center">$P(52)=0.06 \times 0.96 \times 0.98^{50}$</p><p>Following the same procedure: </p><p align="center">$P(53)=0.08 \times 0.94 \times 0.96 \times 0.98^{50}$ <br>  $P(54)=0.10 \times 0.92 \times 0.94 \times 0.96 \times 0.98^{50}$ <br>$P(55)=0.12 \times 0.90 \times 0.92 \times 0.94 \times 0.96 \times 0.98^{50}$ <br> ··· <br>$P(98)=0.98 \times 0.04 \times 0.06 \times \ldots \times 0.94 \times 0.96 \times 0.98^{50}$ <br>$P(99)=1 \times 0.02 \times 0.04 \times 0.06 \times \ldots \times 0.94 \times 0.96 \times 0.98^{50}$ <br></p><p>From the derived equations, we can extract the probability of success component as follows:</p><p align="center">$(0.02+0.02(n-50)), \quad 51 \leq n \leq 99$</p><p>Simplifying to: </p><p align="center">$0.02(n-49), \quad 51 \leq n \leq 99$</p><p>The probability of failure component can be expressed as a product of an arithmetic series, where the probability of failure decreases by 0.02 for each subsequent roll. Following the formula for the product of an arithmetic series:</p><p align="center">$\prod_{k=0}^{n-1}\left(c_{1}-k d\right)$</p><p>Here, $n$ represents the number of rolls, $c_{1}$ is the first term, and $d$ is the common difference. In our case, $k$ will be 51 since our function starts from the 51st roll, $c_{1}$ will be 0.98, and $d$ will be -0.02. Therefore, the probability of failure component in our function is derived as:</p><p>$$<br>\prod_{k&#x3D;51}^{n-1}(0.98-0.02(k-50)), \quad 50&lt;n \leq 99<br>$$</p><p>The notation $k − 50$ indicates that we are treating the 51st roll as the first roll in our equation for the 51st to 99th rolls. This notation can be simplified as follows:</p><p>$$<br>\prod_{k&#x3D;51}^{n-1}(1.98-0.02 k), \quad 50&lt;n \leq 99<br>$$</p><p>Combining each component, we can arrive at the final form of our function for the 51st to 99th rolls:</p><p>$$<br>P(n)&#x3D;0.02(n-49) \times 0.98^{50} \times \prod_{k&#x3D;51}^{n-1}(1.98-0.02 k), \quad 50&lt;n \leq 99<br>$$</p><p>It is important to note that the power notation is structured in a way that for the 51st roll, the initial roll is 51, and the number of rolls is 50. This arrangement results in a value of 1, which is intentionally set up as our probability of failure component for the 51st roll is only $0.98^{50}$.</p><p>With this clarification, our mathematical model is now complete:</p><p>$$<br>P(n) &#x3D;<br>\begin{cases}<br>    0.02 \times 0.98^{n-1}, &amp; 1 \leq n \leq 50 \\<br>    0.02 \times (n-49) \times 0.98^{50} \times \prod_{k&#x3D;51}^{n-1}(1.98-0.02k), &amp; 50 &lt; n \leq 99<br>\end{cases}<br>$$</p><h2 id="Graphing-the-Model"><a href="#Graphing-the-Model" class="headerlink" title="Graphing the Model"></a>Graphing the Model</h2><p>We can create a graph to provide a visual representation of the Arknights character pulling model:</p><p><img src="/img/in-post/Ark-Model.png" alt="The Arknights Character Pulling Model"></p><p>This graph demonstrates the probability of obtaining a six-star unit on the $n^{th}$ roll. Examining the graph, we observe that the initial probability of obtaining a six-star is 2%, which serves as our base probability. As subsequent rolls are considered, the probability gradually decreases. This decline is expected, as it indicates that all previous rolls leading up to the successful pull were unsuccessful. The downward trend persists until the 50th roll, where the probability reaches 0.74%.</p><p>At the 51st roll, the pity system activates, resulting in an upward slope. This upward slope indicates that the pity system is functioning as intended, offering higher probabilities for obtaining a six-star unit. The peak probability of 3.35% occurs at the 56th roll. Following this peak, the probability gradually declines, reflecting the impact of the pity system and previous successful rolls.</p><p>Notably, reaching the 99th roll without obtaining a six-star unit is highly unlikely, with a probability close to 0. Conclusively, most players will achieve success before reaching the later stages of the character pulling system. However, it’s worth noting that the 56th roll, despite having the highest probability, <strong>does not</strong> represent the average roll number we are seeking.</p><h2 id="Solution-1-Cumulative-Probability"><a href="#Solution-1-Cumulative-Probability" class="headerlink" title="Solution 1: Cumulative Probability"></a>Solution 1: Cumulative Probability</h2><p>One approach to determining the average number of rolls required to obtain one six-star unit is to calculate the cumulative probability based on the aforementioned model. The cumulative probability at 50% can serve as an indicator of the average roll, as it signifies that half of the player base has already achieved success in obtaining one six-star unit.</p><p>Using sigma notation to compute the cumulative probability, we obtain:</p><p align="center">$\text { Cumulative Probability }=\sum_{i=1}^{n} P(i), \quad 1 \leq n \leq 99$</p><p>Graphically representing this equation provides further clarity:<br><img src="/img/in-post/Ark-Cumu-Model.png" alt="The Arknights Cumulative Probability Model"></p><p>Upon analyzing the graph, it becomes evident that the cumulative probability reaches 100% at the 99th roll, affirming the accuracy of our equation and model. This validates that the individual probabilities for each roll were calculated correctly, resulting in a cumulative sum of 100%.</p><p>Additionally, the slope of the graph increases notably after the 50th roll, indicating a higher rate of players successfully obtaining a six-star unit due to the implementation of the pity system.</p><p>At the <strong>35th roll</strong>, the cumulative probability stands at 50.69%. This figure represents the average number of rolls required with 50% denoting the point at which half of the player base is expected to have achieved success in obtaining a six-star unit.</p><h2 id="Solution-2-Expected-Values"><a href="#Solution-2-Expected-Values" class="headerlink" title="Solution 2: Expected Values"></a>Solution 2: Expected Values</h2><p>Another approach to determine the average roll is by calculating the expected values, which represent the mean of a probability distribution. For our case of pulling one six-star unit, we can apply the expected value formula. Considering a random variable $X$ with possible rolls $e_{1}, e_{2}, e_{3}, \ldots, e_{n}$ and associated probabilities $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \ldots, a_{n}$, the expected value of $X$ is given by:</p><p align="center">$E(X)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(e_{i} \times a_{i}\right)$</p><p>To calculate the expected value of pulling one six-star unit, we set $e_{i}$ as $i$, since the number of rolls corresponds to the number of trials. The $a_{i}$ values are set as $P(n)$, representing the probability of obtaining one six-star unit for each individual trial. The total number of trials $n$ is set to 99. Therefore, the equation becomes:</p><p align="center">$E(\text { Pulling } 1 \text { Six Star })=\sum_{i=1}^{99}(i \times P(i))$</p><p>Solving this equation yields the result:</p><p align="center">$E(\text { Pulling } 1 \text { Six Star })=34.59$</p><p>Hence, the average number of rolls required to obtain one six-star unit is approximately <strong>34.59 pulls</strong>. This outcome aligns with our cumulative graph, falling between the 34th roll at 49.69% and the 35th roll at 50.69%.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Both solutions lead to a similar conclusion (<strong>34.59%</strong>), which aligns with the cumulative probability graph reaching 100%, as well as other methods like the previously mentioned <a href="https://rpubs.com/zyLiu6707/arknights-pull-simulation">Monte Carlo approach</a> and <a href="https://rpubs.com/Frizu/arknightsgacha">code simulations</a>.</p><p>Taking 35 as the average roll, since rolls are whole numbers, and considering each roll has a cost of 600 Orundum, the average cost of obtaining a six-star unit is 600 × 35 &#x3D; <strong>21,000 Orundum</strong>.</p><p>Additionally, I have created an <strong>Arknights Pull Quantile</strong> table:<br><img src="/img/in-post/Ark-Quantile.png" alt="The Arknights Pull Quantile" width="70%"><br>Using this table, I can determine my “luckiness” based on the number of rolls. For example, in the IL Siracusano Event Banner, where I obtained a six-star unit (Texalter) in 26 rolls, I am ranked in the top 40.86% within the player base. This means that I am luckier than approximately 60% of the gamer population :)</p><h2 id="Evaluations-and-Extensions"><a href="#Evaluations-and-Extensions" class="headerlink" title="Evaluations and Extensions"></a>Evaluations and Extensions</h2><p>The process of finding relationships between individual rolls and solving the complex probability problem unfolded as expected. The presented models accurately illustrate the binomial outcome and cumulative probability in obtaining a six-star unit.</p><p>However, I made several mistakes regarding the probability of failure component during the process. It was only when I graphed the cumulative probability that I realized something was amiss. Through multiple iterations and edits, I eventually reached a cumulative probability of 100%. Each adjustment allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the binomial distribution and the contributions of each component in arriving at the solution.</p><p>This investigation can be extended in various directions. Firstly, exploring additional methods to calculate average roll amounts would be valuable. For example, incorporating the Markov property, which accounts for the dependence of a certain roll’s probability on the outcomes of previous rolls, could offer an intriguing alternative for determining the average roll.</p><p>Another potential extension involves calculating the binomial probability of obtaining a specific six-star unit instead of any six star. This requires accounting for the unique rate of each six-star unit. Consequently, the mathematical model would be adjusted to factor in the varying probabilities associated with each operator.</p><p>Additionally, examining the economic aspect of Arknights and the distribution of the in-game currency Orundum among players could provide valuable insights into player behavior and spending patterns.</p><p>Overall, this post contributes to the growing knowledge base about Arknights, offering a mathematical approach to address the complex issue of obtaining six-star units. Utilizing mathematical modeling techniques, the solutions presented provide players with a better understanding of the game’s mechanics and the resources required to secure their desired operators. </p><p>If you have any questions or would like to explore this topic further, please do not hesitate to reach out.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>“Commit changes”</p></blockquote><p>And so begins Steven’s Blog.</p><p>I’ve been contemplating creating a blog for some time now, centred around my life as an engineering student and highlighting the projects I’ve been diligently working on. The summer before the second year seems like the perfect opportunity to embark on this endeavour.</p><h2 id="How-this-blog-is-made"><a href="#How-this-blog-is-made" class="headerlink" title="How this blog is made"></a>How this blog is made</h2><p>This site is up and running thanks to the elegant <a href="https://hexo.fluid-dev.com/docs/en/">Fluid theme</a> for the static <a href="https://hexo.io/index.html">Hexo framework</a>, and it’s deployed via <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.</p><p>Deploying blogs via GitHub Pages is a popular choice because it offers several advantages:</p><ul><li><strong>Speed</strong>: Website updates in less than a minute.</li><li><strong>Cost-Effective</strong>: GitHub Pages are free to use.</li><li><strong>Simplicity</strong>: You can create new blog posts via git commits.</li><li><strong>Markdown-Based</strong>: We love markdown!</li></ul><p>You can follow the instructions <a href="https://hexo.fluid-dev.com/docs/en/start/">here</a> to start creating your own fluid-themed Hexo blog. You’ll need some familiarity with console commands and front-end languages, mainly HTML and CSS, perhaps a bit of JavaScript if you fancy some customization. But nothing that a quick YouTube search can’t solve.</p><p>Once Fluid is downloaded, configured, and running smoothly locally, you can upload your code and deploy it via GitHub Pages. Alternatively, you can explore other services like <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> or similar options.</p><hr><p>So, welcome to my blog.</p>]]></content>
