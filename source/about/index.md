Welcome to my blog! 

I am Steven, currently a second year electrical engineering student here at the University of British Columbia.

I have worked as a mechanical and manufacturing engineer for the UBC Rocket design team for the past year and is currently interning as a front end engineer.

This blog is built with Hexo and the Fluid Theme.
