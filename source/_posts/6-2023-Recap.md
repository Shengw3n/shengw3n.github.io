This year has been particularly interesting, filled with both success and failure. On one hand, I pursued a degree I am truly passionate about and had the opportunity to intern as an engineer for the first time. On the flip side, I fell short of achieving many of the academic goals I set for myself in the new term, and I take full responsibility for these setbacks.

### About School
My study approach over the past years were to cram everything the night before the exams, a strategy that already revealed signs of weakness in content heavy first year courses such as CHEM 154 and PHYS 158. This approach ultimately led to a rejection letter after my engineering physics interview. The negative impacts only worsened during the 19-credits first semester of my second year in electrical engineering.

However, beyond grades, my primary concern is my attitude towards learning. While I find joy from the content I'm studying, it puzzles me why I consistently leave the materials I'm genuinely interested in until the last minute. This not only hinders my understanding of the subjects but also impedes my ability to engage in deep learning. Yeah I think I have horrible study habits (~~No way Sherlock!~~). 

I have clear long-term goals, but often lack vision for the short term. Hence, in the new year, my plan is to enhance my study habits by attending every class (barring illness) and implementing daily scheduled study sessions to stay on track. Furthermore, I'll write weekly reports documenting my progress, sharing them on this blog as an act of public commitment.

### About Physical Health
Competitive fencing took a backseat after entering university due to a demanding engineering schedule and the two-hour drive to the fencing club. Despite still engaging in occasional fencing, the reduced frequency, coupled with a lack of regular exercise and convenient 2 minutes walking access to McDonald's, resulted in a significant **15 kg** weight gain over two years.

Yeah I have to get back to running and going to the gym. I plan to hit the gym at least twice a week in 2024 and it would also be documented in my weekly reports.

### Inputs & Outputs
#### Intership
[My First Engineering Internship](https://shengw3n.github.io/2023/09/15/4-First-Internship)

#### UBC Rockets
The mechanical components of the rocket are almost complete, just need to add some battery holders and a avionics mount and we are ready for test flights.

#### Books
- **The Hesitating Blade**: incredibly sad book, ending made me depressed for a couple days
- **The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind**: honestly made me rethink a bit about the world
- **小米创业思考**: 创业不易
- **详解FPGA**: 老石写的还是不错的
- **The 5 AM Club**: still reading, I am currently writing this blog at 5 am

#### Shows
- **Bleach: TYBW2**
- **Spy x Family 2**
- **Goblin Slayer 2**
- **Frieren: Beyond Journey's End**, this is going on my top 3 anime of all time, so so good

### Cheers to The New Year
2023 flew by, and here's to an exciting 2024 🥂
