> "Commit changes...”

And so begins Steven’s Blog.

I've been contemplating creating a blog for some time now, centred around my life as an engineering student and highlighting the projects I've been diligently working on. The summer before the second year seems like the perfect opportunity to embark on this endeavour.

### How this blog is made
This site is up and running thanks to the elegant [Fluid theme](https://hexo.fluid-dev.com/docs/en/) for the static [Hexo framework](https://hexo.io/index.html), and it's deployed via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Deploying blogs via GitHub Pages is a popular choice because it offers several advantages:
* **Speed**: Website updates in less than a minute.
* **Cost-Effective**: GitHub Pages are essentially free to use.
* **Simplicity**: You can create new blog posts via git commits.
* **Markdown-Based**: We love markdown!

You can follow the instructions [here](https://hexo.fluid-dev.com/docs/en/start/) to start creating your own fluid-themed Hexo blog. You'll need some familiarity with console commands and front-end languages, mainly HTML and CSS, perhaps a bit of JavaScript if you fancy some customization. But nothing that a quick YouTube search can't solve.

Once Fluid is downloaded, configured, and running smoothly locally, you can upload your code and deploy it via GitHub Pages. Alternatively, you can explore other services like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or similar options.

So, welcome to my blog.
