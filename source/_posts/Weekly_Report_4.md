> This article reflects on my life from the week of `07-22-2024` to `07-28-2024`.

This week, alongside my ongoing CS50 course, I began exploring embedded systems programming through this [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnj-7XwTYRI&list=PLPW8O6W-1chwyTzI3BHwBLbGQoPFxPAPM). The initial lessons evoke memories of coding in Verilog from CPEN 211, as I work closely with registers and memory addresses. This has been a very enjoyable experience, and I’m more excited than ever about programming in general.

### Appreciating the UBC ECE Community
About a month ago, I had an amazing opportunity to interview for a firmware position. While I managed to answer all the theoretical questions, I struggled greatly with the LeetCode-style questions, which ultimately led to a disappointing outcome.

This experience made me realize that I had become overly reliant on AI to write code for me. To overcome this and build a strong foundation for future endeavors, I decided to reach out to the UBC ECE Discord community for help. The response was overwhelming, with a wealth of resources and advice provided almost immediately.

I'm incredibly thankful for the support I received and regret not reaching out sooner. The sense of community and willingness to help was unreal. My goal now is to repay that support by diligently working through the resources and advice to become a better engineer.

### Going to the Gym
Over the past two years at university, I've gained over 10kg of fat, a consequence of stopping fencing daily, a sedentary lifestyle, the all-you-can-eat dining options in first-year residence, and living just a two-minute walk from campus McDonald's in second year. It's time for a change.

This week, a gym rat friend help guided me through the equipments at the local community gym, explaining how to use each piece and which muscles they target. Motivated by this, I purchased a one-month gym pass. I’m excited to embark on this fitness journey and look forward to sharing my progress.
