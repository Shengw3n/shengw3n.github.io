During the summer, I traveled back to China to visit my grandparents, marking my first return in over four years due to COVID-19 restrictions. While in China, I applied for an internship at a  local storage robotics company known as [Bullseye](https://en.ny-zn.com/). Bullseye specializes in designing and manufacturing storage robotics for large corporations such as Starbucks, Siemens, and Jingdong. (You can click on their website for a fascinating animation demonstrating how these robots operate.)

Initially, I applied for a position as an embedded engineer, but during the interview, we realized that I wouldn't have enough time to learn the necessary skills for embedded engineering, given that I needed to return to school in September. Which is fair since I had just completed my first year of studies.

However, they offered an alternative opportunity: interning as a front-end developer. Without hesitation, I accepted their offer, read through the internship and employee policies, and signed both the internship contract and the non-disclosure agreement. And now, here I am, in my first ever cubicle.

## What I Learned
Working from 8 to 5 as a front-end developer, the role involved utilizing languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vue to create user interfaces. At Bullseye, this meant designing interfaces for controlling storage robotics and providing information about warehouse occupancy, item locations, and more.

Although front-end development differs significantly from electrical engineering, I found the subject extremely engaging. The ability to present data and information in a visually pleasing manner resonated with me, and the coding skills I acquired during my internship ultimately enabled me to create and maintain this blog.

Beyond technical skills, I also gained insights into the inner workings of an engineering R&D company. This environment was a stark contrast to my previous job as a fencing coach, where I was constantly surrounded by younger children. At Bullseye, the atmosphere was both serious and engaging. My colleagues were incredibly friendly, and whenever I had questions about my tasks, my manager is always there to support me. Furthermore, the human resources department was equally accommodating, always ready to address any queries I had.

In addition, due to a shortage of available cubicles in the R&D department, I was assigned to sit with the sales department. Listening to their daily sales calls also provided me with an unusual but valuable experience.
## Monday Morning Meetings
Every Monday morning, my colleagues and I would assemble in formation, much like soldiers. We'd begin by reciting the company's goals, and our director would then go on to list the accomplishments of each department from the previous week and note any follow-up tasks. Afterward, he'd assign new tasks to each department and share major updates, such as new clients, challenges, and achievements. The meeting lasted less than 10 minutes, but it had a profound impact on everyone's morale. Perhaps it's a tradition in Chinese companies to infuse enthusiasm and motivation into their work culture.

## The Lunch Breaks
Our lunch break commences at 12 p.m. and extends for an hour. The office was conveniently located near several restaurants, and the best part was that we received lunch subsidies. I must say, I absolutely relished dining in China.

## The Takeaway
I'm uncertain whether I'll ever use front-end coding in my electrical engineering career, but I'm certain that without this internship, I wouldn't have been able to create this blog. Working at an actual engineering company over the summer was an enjoyable and enlightening experience. I acquired numerous skills that are transferable to various other positions and endeavours. As the UBC Co-op office advises, seize every learning opportunity that comes your way, and your path will unfold before you.
